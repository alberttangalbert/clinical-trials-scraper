    "Brief Summary": "This study will test the reliability of a procedure for self-administering ethanol (alcohol) intravenously (through a vein), using a computer-assisted method. People ordinarily self-administer alcohol through drinking alcoholic beverages, but blood alcohol levels resulting from drinking vary greatly among individuals. For research on alcohol dependence and treatment, a tool for achieving precise blood levels is needed. In addition to testing this method of alcohol administration, the study will examine self-administration behavior and resulting breath alcohol concentration, the effects of alcohol on the participants, and differences between men and women in alcohol self-administration.\n\nHealthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants are assigned to one of two study groups. Group 1 undergoes three 7-hour study sessions and group 2 participates in two sessions, each of which includes the following procedures:\n\n* Breathalyzer and urine tests for alcohol and illicit drug use.\n* Urine pregnancy test for women.\n* Light lunch.\n* Questionnaire about health and recent drinking.\n\nAlcohol infusion: Subjects are seated in a comfortable chair and instructed on how to use a computer to give themselves a short infusion of alcohol through a catheter (plastic tube) that has been inserted into a vein in their the arm. Sensors are placed on their chest to monitor heart beat and their neck to record skin blood flow. At the start of the session, subjects complete questionnaires about any drug effects and urges to drink they may be feeling. They are trained on how to use the computer to administer alcohol and are then allowed to self-administer alcohol through the catheter any time they like, as long as their peak breath alcohol level does not exceed 0.1 g% (a level that would result from ingestion of 4 to 6 drinks in most people). If that point is reached, the computer automatically inactivates self-administration until the level is lowered again. Breathalyzer readings are taken every 15 to 30 minutes. Subjects may read, watch television or videos or listen to music during the sessions.\n\nRecovery: At the end of the 2.5 hours of self-administration, the catheter is removed and subjects can eat, read, watch television and relax in the clinic until their breath alcohol level falls below 0.02 g%, usually after 2.5 to 3 hours, when they can go home by taxi or with a pre-arranged designated driver.",
    "Detailed Description": "Objective: The goal of this project is to characterize the computer-assisted self-administration of ethanol (CASE) paradigm by assessing intravenous (IV) alcohol self-administration behavior and the resulting breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) exposure and pharmacologic responses in humans. The study will also evaluate the test-retest reliability of alcohol self-administration and examine the influence of sex and recent drinking history, as well as the effect of acute stress cues on alcohol self-administration. Additionally, this study will test whether a novel experimental paradigm can be used to evaluate impaired control in\n\nheavy drinkers.\n\nStudy population: Participants will be 21-60 year-old male and female social drinkers, binge drinkers and heavy drinkers in good health, as determined by medical history, physical exam, ECG and lab tests. Participants with Axis-I psychiatric illness (other than alcohol use disorder for Group 6) will be excluded.\n\nDesign: The CASE system utilizes a model-based algorithm based on previously published methods to achieve and maintain pre-determined BrACs using IV alcohol infusions. The CASE system provides flexibility to participants in choosing when to push a button to receive alcohol, as well as flexibility to investigators in controlling the subsequent BrAC exposure. The CASE system allows the investigator to specify and assure the same BrAC increment across all participants, and is set up to prevent the BrAC from exceeding any pre-set upper limit (e.g., 120 mg%).\n\nFollowing screening, participants will undergo IV ethanol self-administration sessions. Participants will be enrolled in six groups: Group 1 will consist of the first 10 participants who will participate in 3 self-administration sessions (a training session followed by 2 test sessions) to assess the test-retest reliability of alcohol self-administration behavior. Group 2 will consist of 50 participants, who will each participate in 2 self-administration sessions (a training session followed by a test session). During each session, participants will first undergo a directed priming period, lasting 25 min, where they will be prompted to push a button to receive small standardized alcohol infusions. This will be followed by an ad-lib period, lasting up to 2 hrs, where they will have free access to standardized IV alcohol infusions. During the session, BrAC will be measured, heart-rate will be continuously recorded, and subjective perceptions of alcohol effects and urges will be assessed. Group 3 will consist of 15 participants, who will undergo two identical progressive work self-administration sessions for evaluation of test-retest reliability. During each progressive ratio (PR) schedule session, participants will be required to push the button progressively higher number of times for each subsequent alcohol infusion over a 2.5 hr period. Group 4 will consist of 100 participants, who will each participate in 2 sessions: one ad lib self-administration session and one PR schedule self-administration session. Group 5 will consist of 40 participants, who will undergo a baseline self-administration session followed by an interview session for construction of guided imagery scripts. Following this, participants will undergo three alcohol self-administration sessions, following exposure to personalized stress-, alcohol- or neutral-condition associated scripts, presented in randomized order on separate days. Group 6a will consist of a maximum of 15 participants who will undergo a baseline self-administration session followed by an experimental session in which they will be given the opportunity to resist receiving self-infusions of alcohol in return for monetary reinforcers. Group 6b will consist of 37 participants who will complete a baseline self-administration session followed by two experimental sessions, with and without a priming dose of alcohol, and two follow up visits. Group 6 participants will also be given an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) device and will complete random assessments of real-world measures of impaired control and alcohol consumption per day for the duration of the study.\n\nOutcome measures: The primary endpoint is the BrAC exposure (highest BrAC, average BrAC, area-under-the-BrAC-time-curve) achieved during the self-administration session. Additionally, changes in subjective perceptions of alcohol effects, as well as changes in heart rate will be evaluated. The influence of sex and recent drinking history as well as genetic polymorphisms on the self-administration of alcohol will also be examined. Furthermore, individual-specific cellular responses to alcohol exposure will be examined using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from participants selected based on genotypic and phenotypic variation in self-administration measures. Outcome measures for group 5 will include stress and alcohol cue-induced craving and self-administration. Human laboratory outcome\n\nmeasures for Group 6 will include time to lapse during the delay phase, number of infusions,\n\npeak BrAC, and average BrAC during the ad-libitum phase. EMA outcomes will include\n\ntotal alcohol consumption, number of impaired control episodes, and severity of impaired\n\ncontrol episodes. The CASE paradigm can be a valuable tool for evaluating determinants that may underlie self-administration behavior in humans. The effect of pharmacological agents on alcohol self-administration can be evaluated as a marker of the clinical effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of alcohol-dependence.",

    "Brief Summary": "This study will evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of an experimental tracking device for locating abnormalities during invasive procedures, such as biopsy or ablation, that cannot easily be visualized by usual imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) scans or ultrasound. Some lesions, such as certain liver or kidney tumors, small endocrine abnormalities, and others, may be hard to find or only visible for a few seconds. The new method uses a needle with a miniature tracking device buried inside the metal that tells where the tip of the needle is located, somewhat like a mini GPS, or global positioning system. It uses a very weak magnet to localize the device like a miniature satellite system. This study will explore whether this system can be used in the future to more accurately place the needle in or near the desired location or abnormality.\n\nPatients 18 years of age and older who have a lesion that needs to be biopsied or an ablation procedure that requires CT guidance may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and review of medical records, including imaging studies.\n\nParticipants undergo the biopsy or ablation procedure as they normally would, with the following exceptions: some stickers are placed on the skin before the procedure and a very weak magnet is placed nearby. The needles used are similar to the ones that would normally be used except that they contain a metal coil or spring buried deep within the needle metal. The procedure involves the following steps:\n\n1. Small 1-cm plastic donuts are place on the skin with tape.\n2. A planning CT scan is done.\n3. The CT scan is sent to the computer and matched to the patient's body location with the help of a very weak magnet.\n4. The needle used for the procedure is placed towards the target tissue or abnormality and the \"smart needle\" location lights up on the old CT scan.\n5. A repeat CT is done as it normally is to look for the location of the needle.\n6. After the procedure the CT scans are examined to determine how well the new tool located the needle in the old scan....",
    "Detailed Description": "Background:\n\nThe effectiveness of targeting lesions or a specific area for surgery, angiography, CT-guided, or ultrasound-guided biopsy, or ablation, currently may be limited by the visibility of a target during the procedure. Accurate therapeutic intervention may depend upon accurate device placement, which may be very difficult in certain settings, such as when a liver tumor only is visible for a brief moment in time during the transient arterial phase of a contrast injection, soon disappearing on dynamic imaging. Surgery, angiography, image guided therapies and diagnostic procedures could be vastly improved by enabling the use of pre-procedural imaging during the procedure \\[such as location of difficult to visualize or transiently visible targets\\].Tracking devices allow the use of preoperative imaging during the procedure. Having this information available could vastly improve targeting accuracy of surgery, angiography, CT-guided, or ultrasound-guided biopsy or ablation.\n\nA method of improving targeting could potentially benefit patients in the future by reducing total radiation exposure during CT scan or fluoroscopic monitoring of a biopsy, or decreasing certain surgical risks, although these are not specific subjects of this study. Various methods of device tracking have been used in the past throughout the 20th and 21st century in neurosurgery with the use of stereotactic frames for a similar purpose, to register pre-operative imaging to the patient during invasive procedures to guide treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo define the clinical utility of electromagnetic tracking during interventional procedures in specific patient populations.\n\nEligibility:\n\n1. All patients must have a CT, MR, or PET scan available in digital format.\n2. Age greater than 18 years.\n3. Patients must be actively enrolled on an NIH protocol and be scheduled for surgery, angiography, or CT- or ultrasound-guided biopsy.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is an exploratory interventional study examining the use of a guidance system for navigating and monitoring devices like biopsy and ablation needles, ultrasound transducers, needle guides, guidewires, scalpels, and cauterization devices (herein referred to as device(s) ) for localization in relation to pre-operative images. There are 9 cohorts included in this protocol: The Open / Laparoscopic surgery and Angiography surgery cohorts are no longer open for accrual.\n\n1. Prostate biopsy\n2. Percutaneous biopsy for diagnostic correlation\n3. percutaneous ablation for needle placement compilations\n4. Open/Laparoscopic surgery\n5. Angiography\n6. Auto registration for biopsy\n7. Auto registration for ablation\n8. PET registration\n9. prostate biopsy on which to determine the predictive value and relative strength of each MRI sequence in predicting cancer at a specific prostate core location.\n\nThe total accrual ceiling for this protocol is 3894 subjects.\n\nAll cohorts open for accrual are using exploratory interventions to define the specific patient population where fusion used during interventional procedures may have clinical value, and to characterize that clinical value in a specific patient population, such as but not limited to patients with specific regions of the prostate targeted, specific prostate volumes, prior negative prostate biopsies, or PSA values within a specific range.",

This study is designed to examine the effects of the body from harmful algae blooms (HAB) as well as possibility of an association between exposure to the marine toxin, brevetoxin (PbTx), which is released from K. brevis during the red tide bloom, and the prevalence of neurological illnesses.",
    "Detailed Description": "Exposure to environmental toxins present in local waters, such as brevetoxins released by Karenia brevis (K. brevis) or microcystin produced by cyanobacteria, is known to cause skin and eye irritation, gastrointestinal and respiratory distress. The ingestion of high levels of brevetoxins from eating contaminated shellfish can result in Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP), an acute gastroenteritis with accompanying neurologic symptoms. People are often exposed by direct skin contact with contaminated waters, drinking contaminated water, breathing in airborne droplets of the toxins, or eating contaminated shellfish. This condition usually resolves itself within 3 days as the brevetoxins are excreted from the body. Aerosolized brevetoxins are also known to cause a reversible upper respiratory syndrome, characterized by coughing, sneezing, and feelings of irritation to the airways. Once the exposure to the brevetoxin-laden air has ceased, symptoms usually go away within 15 minutes.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to determine if exposure to marine or similar environmental toxins can adversely affect CNS health, immune system, respiratory system and other biological processes which contribute to long-term cognitive dysfunction or illnesses in individuals exposed to these toxins.\n\nSponsor will be examining whether general health signs and symptoms that are reported are as associated with the exposure to harmful algal bloom toxins. Known symptoms of exposure to harmful algae bloom/red tide /shellfish include the following: Skin and eye irritation, gastrointestinal and respiratory distress, acute gastroenteritis with accompanying neurologic symptoms, respiratory distress, such as reversible upper respiratory syndrome with symptoms of coughing, sneezing, and feelings of irritation to the airways.",

Computers assemble this data to make the images doctors look at. A new computer technique can make higher resolution images from the same CT scans. In this natural history study, researchers will take normal CT images of the heart. They will compare those images to super high-resolution (super high-res) images made with a super-computer.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo improve the quality of heart CT scans by using new methods to create the images.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years or older who need a CT scan for heart disease.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have a normal CT scan. A substance will be injected through a tube in their arm. They will lie on a table in a large, donut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube will move around their body, taking many pictures.\n\nResearchers will use the normal CT scans to create super high-res images. They may do this at the NIH. They may also send the images to the company that made the CT scanner. Participants personal information will be removed before images are sent to the company. The personal information will be replaced by a code.\n\nThe super high-res images will be returned to the NIH.\n\nSome information will be collected from participants medical records.

    "Detailed Description": "Study Description:\n\nThis is an observational technical development study of advanced mathematical image reconstruction of raw CT data on patients with structural heart disease, in order to create better pictures.\n\nThe raw CT data are obtained in the course of clinically-indicated contrast-enhanced time-resolved cardiac CT without any change in clinical practice. The raw data are acquired on a specific imaging system (Canon Aquilion One) at the enrolling site(s).\n\nSubjects are recruited among candidates selected clinically to undergo time-resolved cardiac CT in the diagnosis and treatment of structural heart disease. After consenting in writing, data are abstracted from their medical record, and the raw CT data used for standard medical care are copied. There is no investigational component to the standard clinical CT data acquisition and there is no change in radiation exposure from standard clinical CT examination. Subject participation concludes at the end of the standard clinical CT examination.\n\nThe raw CT data are sent with PII to NHLBI investigators who will remove identifiers and replace with a code before transmitting the image to the industry collaborator (Canon) for investigational advanced mathematical image reconstruction. The reconstructed CT images are then transmitted back to the NHLBI where the images are re-identified. The NHLBI investigators will then forward the reconstructed image to the site investigators. The advanced image reconstruction may be performed at NHLBI once adequate computer resources are available.\n\nThe research analysis consists of a comparison of standard CT images from the enrolling site with the advanced mathematical image reconstructions (\"investigational images\") for quality metrics.\n\nThe investigational advanced mathematical image reconstruction kernel may be changed iteratively for the purpose of technical development during this study.\n\nThe advanced image reconstruction is considered investigational because it is a commercial device not yet cleared for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration. The advanced image reconstruction yields images with four-fold higher spatial resolution that standard images, based on the same standard CT acquisition. The advanced reconstruction images are labeled investigational and offer potential benefit to research subjects who are also patients. Therefore, the images are labeled investigational and returned to the local physician-investigators, to use at their discretion. This includes the possibility of informing medical decision-making based on investigational higher-resolution images.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe objective of this research protocol is to determine whether advanced mathematical image reconstructions create superior images compared with standard cardiac CT image reconstruction in patients with structural heart disease.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThe primary endpoint is a semi-quantitative measure of superiority of advanced mathematical image reconstruction compared with standard cardiac CT image reconstruction for study-specific fine detail.\n\nSecondary endpoints include quantitative signal-to-noise (SNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR), and image noise.\n\nExploratory endpoints include Likert-type scales of image noise, artifacts, subjective image contrast, image sharpness, and diagnostic confidence.",

    "Detailed Description": "This is an exploratory natural history protocol that enrolls patients with known or as yet undiagnosed disorders of inflammation. Blood, saliva, or buccal samples will be collected for genetic analysis, blood samples will be obtained for immunologic and other functional studies, a small number of subjects may undergo skin biopsy, leukapheresis, or bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and some subjects will be provided standard medical care follow up, with retrospective analysis of the clinical data gathered during follow up. The primary objective is to discover the genetic basis of human disorders of inflammation. The secondary objective is to enumerate immunologic features and genotype-phenotype associations in specific autoinflammatory diseases. The tertiary objective is to describe the clinical features of poorly characterized or newly defined disorders of inflammation. This protocol provided clinical support for the identification of the gene mutated in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), the discovery of the TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), the identification of NLRP3 mutations in the neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), the discovery of the deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), and the proposal of the now widely accepted concept of autoinflammatory disease. During the last decade the protocol has provided the clinical foundation for the discovery of ten more monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, seven of which were previously unrecognized as distinct diseases. The protocol has also permitted numerous studies delineating the mechanisms of autoinflammation and its connections with the human innate immune system. The work catalyzed by this protocol has provided the conceptual basis for a number of targeted therapies. During the next decade the objective will be to utilize cutting edge genomic technologies to further advance discovery.",

    "Detailed Description": "Water is K'\u00e9 is a culturally-grounded, family-based intervention designed to promote healthy beverage consumption among Navajo families. Delivered by early child education (ECE) staff, Water is K'\u00e9 includes three strategies: promoting Din\u00e9 (Navajo) culture through intergenerational sharing, increasing health literacy about water and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and increasing drinking water access in both home and ECE settings. Activities consist of a lesson plan for children and caregivers, a tailored access plan to promote confidence in water quality at home and ECE sites; and a social media campaign. Water is K'\u00e9 is guided by the conceptual framework of the Navajo Wellness Model, addressing four aspects: spiritual; sustenance; family and kinship (K'\u00e9); and the environment. The intervention's goal is to promote healthy behaviors and intergenerational sharing of cultural teachings about water, resulting in better health among family members and greater family cohesion overall.\n\nThis prospective cluster-randomized trial evaluates the impact of Water is K'\u00e9 on healthy beverage consumption, health outcomes, and family cohesion. A total of 25 ECE sites will be enrolled in the study, serving in the waitlist group for one year, and then the intervention group the following year based on random assignment. Stepwise roll-out will ensure adequate bandwidth to support intervention sites, while also gathering control data from waitlist sites. Primary caregivers will consent for themselves and the child who is enrolled in the ECE program; other family members will be invited to enroll in the study as well. Each site will enroll approximately 11 families per year, resulting in a total enrollment of 440 families (220 in the intervention group, 220 in the control group) and follow them for 12 months to evaluate the impact on behaviors (beverage consumption patterns) and health outcomes (body mass index, A1c among adults living with diabetes or pre-diabetes) of children and adults. In addition, convergent parallel mixed methods will be used to explore whether Water is K'\u00e9 results in greater family cohesion through intergenerational cultural continuity. Specific aims are:\n\n1. Evaluate the impact of Water is K'\u00e9 on children aged 2 to 5. Hypothesis: participating children will have healthier beverage habits and body mass indices compared with children in the control group.\n2. Evaluate intervention impact on the health of other family members. Hypothesis: participating individuals will have healthier beverage habits and body mass indices compared with the control group.\n3. Evaluate the intervention's impact on family well-being. Hypothesis: participating families will have stronger family cohesion through strengthening of intergenerational cultural continuity compared with families in the control group.",

    "Brief Summary": "Background Our understanding of PD has stagnated, partly due to the limited patient diversity and brief followup captured in most study cohorts. Additionally, potentially valuable biomarkers derived from different types of measurements are rarely analyzed in an integrated fashion.\n\nObjective This study aims to create a longitudinal dataset of clinical, molecular, imaging, and continuous wearable sensor-based data from a representative Parkinson's disease (PD) cohort. Data will be made available to researchers worldwide to accelerate the discovery of novel etiological insights, development of new therapeutic approaches, and personalized disease management. For this purpose, an extensible norm for sharing research data will be developed, meeting the latest data privacy and security standards.\n\nMethods Supported by a multinational, public-private partnership, a prospective cohort study was designed to include 650 representative PD patients (disease duration \\<5 years). Comprehensive follow-up for at least 2 years includes: (1) annual assessment at the study center for acquisition of detailed clinimetric data, magnetic resonance imaging, and biospecimens (plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), stool) and (2) collection of data from the home environment, using self-assessments and an advanced wrist-worn wearable device to continuously measure biological and environmental signals. Collection, storage, and sharing of these research data will be facilitated by a new method to protect privacy and enhance security using polymorphic encryption and pseudonymization (PEP), a methodology that combines advanced encryption with distributed pseudonymization and data access management.\n\nConclusion This study is unique, as it includes a cohort of unbiased subjects with recently diagnosed PD, creating an unprecedented dataset that combines longitudinally collected clinical, molecular, imaging, and data from wearable sensors using state of the art technology. The single-center study design minimizes measurement variability. Finally, the innovative methodology for data privacy and protection might serve as a new international standard for sharing research data.",
    "Detailed Description": "The Personalized Parkinson Project proposes an unbiased approach to biomarker development with multiple clinical, genomic and other molecular, and imaging biomarkers measured in a large population, measured at 3 time points (baseline visit, one year follow-up, and two years' follow-up). In addition, the study protocol includes day-to-day patient monitoring with a multisensor wearable device, the Verily Study Watch, that continuously collects data (movement, pulse, skin temperature, ambient information) and allows for real-time data collection between study visits. The goal of the device is to collect high-resolution, continuous biological signals from the body. These measurements of physiology, activity, and environmental conditions over the course of a 2-year study will be used to create a quantified functional assessment of patients with PD. Mapping these signals with clinical outcomes such as disease progression will allow the investigators to evaluate the relationship between biosensor data and the clinical variables, genotypic, and imaging biomarkers collected in the study.\n\nThis study is intended to create a unique resource of genotypic, functional, and phenotypic data collected longitudinally on a cohort of Dutch subjects with PD (n=650), allowing the Research Collaborators to address a series of hypothesis-driven research questions. The aim is to develop novel etiological insights, to identify biomarkers that can assist in predicting differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients, to improve existing treatments, to develop new therapeutic approaches, and to develop a more precise and personalized disease management approach.\n\nAdditionally, the cohort will serve as a source of data that can be accessed by qualified researchers worldwide, allowing them to add their research capacity to further address the main aims of this study. For this reason, data governance will be managed by dedicated advisory boards and data review committees, as specified in the study protocol. Participation in this study and results from this study will not be used for patient treatment decisions.\n\nThe aim of this study is threefold:\n\n1. The primary objective of the study is to perform a set of hypothesis-driven analyses on the study data set, aiming to correlate established biomarkers (obtained clinically, from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), from known genetic factors, and from monitoring of biosensors signals) to the rate of disease progression, and to responses to treatment (both pharmacological and behavioral, such as participation in exercise). Also, the investigators aim to identify biomarkers that can assist in predicting differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients. Finally, by developing novel etiological and pathophysiological insights, the study aims to improve existing treatments and to develop new therapeutic approaches, as a basis for development of a more precise and personalized disease management approach.\n2. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the Verily Study Watch, to assess how these devices could provide information about the function of patients with PD.\n3. The tertiary objective of this study is to create an extensive longitudinal dataset describing the genetic, clinical, functional, and phenotypic characteristics of a representative Parkinson's disease (PD) subject cohort (n = 650) to allow researchers to investigate important unanswered questions in PD.",

Self-report methods (e.g., 24-hour recall and food records) have their strengths and are frequently used to measure children's EI. Nonetheless, they also have significant limitations, including participant and caregiver burden and lack of near real-time data.\n\nOur group developed the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) to measure the EI of adults in near real-time and the validity data in adults are exceptional; the RFPM underestimates EI in laboratory settings by less than 6% and in free-living conditions by less than 7% compared to weighed foods and by less than 4% compared to doubly labeled water (DLW) over 6 days. At the same time, participant burden is drastically reduced compared to self-report methods, as participants are only required to capture images of their food selection and plate waste with a smartphone app and send these images to the laboratory for analysis. This validation study aims to assess the accuracy of the RFPM and SmartIntake app in a sample of adolescents in free-living conditions.",

    "Detailed Description": "Overall, the Egypt Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) results indicate that 60% of currently married women in Egypt are using contraception. The IUD, pill, and injectable are the most widely used methods: 36% of currently married women interviewed for the Egypt Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) use the IUD, 12% rely on the pill, and 7% utilize injectable.\n\nIUD insertion possess numerous complications which includes low back pain, cervical problems, syncope, bradycardia, convulsions, perforation, expulsion, frequent bleeding , all affecting the quality of life of women.\n\nAnalgesia has been used by many patients for relieving their low back pain symptoms. Unfortunately, despite of its fast relieving effects, analgesics can cause side effects as heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, stomach ulcers and liver damage. This draws the necessity to consider the use of physical therapy modalities for the treatment of low back pain like active exercises, various elecyrotherapy modalities with the emphasis on the use of acupressure and Kinesotape.\n\nNumerous studies have addressed the effect of acupressure on LBP. A previous study showed that acupressure could reduce postpartum LBP intensity. Also, it was reported that applying pressure on specific acupoints reduced LBP among nurses.\n\nAlso, previous studies have shown that KT improves blood and lymph circulation, mitigates pain, adjusts joints, and relives muscle tension. Previous research examined the effects of Kinesiotaping on LBP associated with pregnancy and showed that the intensity of LBP was lower in the group of the Kinesiotape and paracetamol than in the group that took paracetamol alone.\n\nTill now there is no previous study differentiate between the effect of kinesiotape and acupressure in the management of low back pain in women with intrauterine device. So, the study will be conducted to determine which of them is more effective on relieving intrauterine device related low back pain which will be of valuable benefits and increased body of knowledge of physical therapists in scientific field.",

    "Brief Summary": "Early diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in 50-70% of youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and confers high lifetime risk of dialysis and premature death. Youth-onset T2D typically manifests during or shortly after puberty in adolescents with obesity. Epidemiological data implicate puberty as an accelerator of kidney disease in youth with obesity and diabetes and the investigators posit that the link between puberty and T2D-onset may explain the high burden of DKD in youth-onset T2D. A better understanding of the impact of puberty on kidney health is needed to promote preservation of native kidney function, especially in youth with T2D.",
    "Detailed Description": "Puberty is a complex process of physiological changes, including neuroreproductive and growth hormone activation and rapid organ growth, that may predispose organs to injury. The kidneys may be especially susceptible because they are highly metabolically active and second only to the heart with respect to oxygen consumption per tissue mass. During puberty, the kidneys almost double in size, likely increasing the kidneys' already high energy expenditure. In parallel, puberty is associated with physiologic insulin resistance (IR), which is accentuated in obesity. Our central hypothesis is that obese youth with prediabetes and T2D experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to a metabolic mismatch between increased energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In turn, the kidney hypoxia results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity leading to increased transglomerular transport of protein and kidney dysfunction. Our preliminary data showed that pubertal adolescents with obesity and/or diabetes exhibit relative kidney hypoxia compared to normal weight controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and that relative kidney hypoxia is greater in late vs. early puberty. However, determining the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney injury in youth with obesity and T2D requires serial evaluations throughout puberty. To assess the impact of pubertal changes within a 5-year study period, the investigators propose an accelerated longitudinal study design in which the investigators will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with obesity and/or elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c \u22656%) \\[n=60\\], and healthy normoglycemic controls \\[n=40\\] at Tanner (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-years. The investigators will then compare data by Tanner stage to construct an integrated portrayal of the physiological changes that occur throughout puberty. Given the rarity of T2D prior to pubertal onset, the investigators chose to enroll a high high-risk group: youth with obesity and/or HbA1c \u22656.0% to represent youth ranging from those at magnified risk of developing T2D to those recently diagnosed.",

    "Brief Summary": "Dietary intake of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) may have beneficial effects on host health by affecting the microbiota composition and -activity. So far studies focused on analyses in fecal samples, while the primary site of carbohydrate fermentation is the proximal colon. To date, no studies have been performed in humans on the more proximal microbiota and the impact of fermentable carbohydrates. Further insights on the more proximal colonic microbiota would aid to targeted approaches to improve intestinal health. Therefore, we aim to study the effect of GOS on the intestinal microbiota composition and -activity in healthy adults, by sampling the more proximal human colon in a physiological condition. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of four weeks GOS supplementation on intestinal microbiota composition and -activity, by sampling the proximal part of the human colon in a physiological condition. Furthermore, this study has four secondary objectives: First, to compare the intestinal microbiota composition and -activity of the proximal colon vs. distal colon at baseline and after four weeks GOS supplementation. Second, compare the luminal microbiota composition vs. mucosa adherent microbiota composition of the proximal vs. distal colon at baseline and after four weeks GOS supplementation. Third, monitor the effects of four weeks GOS supplementation on gastrointestinal symptoms. The study conforms to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Study population includes healthy human volunteers (male and female), 18-50 years of age. One intervention arm will include 7.2 grams of Vivinal\u00ae GOS Powder three times daily for four weeks. The other intervention arm subjects will receive placebo product (7.2 grams maltodextrin) three times daily for four weeks. At the start and end of the intervention period, several measurements will take place. The main study parameter is the change in microbial composition and -activity induced by GOS intervention.",

    "Detailed Description": "Tourniquets are widely accepted as \"safe\" for up to two hours of continued use, despite known risks and a paucity of literature supporting this duration. Complications of tourniquets include tourniquet site pain, increased surgical site pain and swelling from reperfusion, neuropraxia, vascular injury, functional weakness, and decreased muscle endurance. Similar to compartment syndrome, tourniquets eliminate the tissue perfusion gradient necessary for oxygen, glucose, and lactic acid exchange.

    "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this research is to better understand how emotion processing unfolds in the brain using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) and direct brain stimulation. This study will use standard behavioral emotion processing tasks combined with neural recording and direct brain stimulation to assess different aspects of emotion processing. Stimulation pulses during pre and post-test periods will assess the effects of stimulation before and after conditioning, the results of which will be combined with results from the activity of each electrode during the emotion tasks to inform us of the nature of emotion processing in the brain and allow us to devise brain modulation protocols in the future.",
    "Detailed Description": "About half of the 70M persons with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide will suffer from comorbid mental health disorders (MHDs), with depression and anxiety estimated to be the most prevalent. MHDs and epilepsy each pose significant barriers to work, social functioning, physical disability, and increased risk of mortality. While pathophysiology of epilepsy and anxiety involves similar brain circuits, identifying specific network disruptions that cause emotion regulation dysfunction would critically inform treatment targets for both conditions. Disruptions in the fronto-limbic network (i.e., prefrontal cortex; cingulate cortex; insula; hippocampus; amygdala) are linked to anxiety disorders and impaired emotion response regulation. Likewise, epilepsies are associated with aberrant fronto-limbic function and connectivity that underlie emotion processing. Further, emotion regulation and anxiety symptom severity improve with better seizure control and vice versa. Despite this converging evidence, fronto-limbic circuit disruption that modulates emotion regulation dysfunction in PWE and MHDs remains poorly understood. The goal of the proposed pilot work is to test whether stimulation of specific brain regions modulates the function and connectivity of these networks as well as corresponding regulation of emotional responses. I will achieve the goal of this study by harnessing the novel and innovative approach of stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) available in UAB's epilepsy monitoring unit as part of standard of care among epilepsy surgery candidates.\n\nNeural recordings that map human brain function underlying behavior and cognition have provided substantial insights into the organization of brain networks and have provided a springboard for launching investigations into developing new interventions. Further, invasive neural recordings in humans provide an unparalleled window into neural circuitry underlying complex moods, emotions, cognition, and behaviors with high spatial and temporal resolution. Assessment of neural circuity underlying these important functions is also critical for the best clinical care of patients undergoing resective surgery to treat epilepsy. In particular, sEEG is a minimally invasive clinical procedure in which electrodes are surgically implanted into the brain in order to better localize the seizure focus. During the post-implantation period, sEEG records directly from an array of depth electrodes implanted throughout the brain to capture spatio-temporal transitions within broadly distributed functional brain networks on a finer neuroanatomical (millimeter) and temporal (millisecond) scale than possible with relatively abundant and standard functional neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI) and electrophysiology techniques (e.g., EEG). Additionally, sEEG provides the ability to stimulate those circuits via the same electrodes by delivering mild intra-cranial electrical stimulations in different brain structures to estimate their impact on cognitive tasks. Thus, sEEG serves as a powerful tool to explore the neural circuitry underlying complex moods, emotions, cognition, and behaviors via non-stimulation recordings for establishing correlations among brain function, connectivity, and behavior, as well as mapping stimulation-manipulated brain-behavior relationships. However, limited applications have been utilized to date for studies of emotion processes. Pavlovian fear conditioning is an effective and widespread paradigm often used in both human and non-human animal models to study emotional learning, memory, and regulation processes. In a typical Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, a warning cue, also called a conditioned stimulus (CS+), is paired with a threat (e.g., 100 db static sound, 0.5s), also called an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). A distinct safety cue (CS-) can also be paired with the absence of a threat. After repeated pairings of these stimuli (conditioning trials), only the warning cue begins to produce a conditioned response (CR). The CR is often taken as evidence that the association between the warning cue and threat has been learned. However, learning-related changes in the response to threat, also called the unconditioned response (UCR), are frequently observed. Conditioned diminution of the response to threat is demonstrated by a diminished emotional threat response (e.g., skin conductance) when the threat follows a warning cue (i.e., predictable threat) compared to when a threat follows a safety cue or is presented alone (i.e., unpredictable threat). This conditioned diminution of the threat response provides a continuous measure of the ability to regulate the emotional response to threat. Further, this paradigm has been utilized by our study team to report function and connectivity of the fronto-limbic network correlated with inhibition of emotion responses in healthy controls using fMRI. However, assessing experimenter-induced changes in function, connectivity, and behavior via stimulation of the fronto-limbic brain regions would provide the critical next step of a more rigorous test of the causal hypotheses regarding this brain-behavior relationship.\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of treatment resistant epilepsy. Patients with TLE frequently undergo sEEG evaluation for possible resective surgery and they are an ideal study population to assess brain-behavior relations in emotion processes. TLE is also characterized by a high rate of anxiety disorder comorbidity and is associated with dysfunction within the fronto-limbic circuit underlying emotion processes. The comorbidity between epilepsy and anxiety may arise due to a large degree of overlapping changes within fronto-limbic network that are linked to symptoms of anxiety. Specifically, frontal lobe connectivity with medial temporal regions (i.e., prefrontal cortex; cingulate cortex; hippocampus; amygdala) via the cingulum bundle is an important network involved in seizure propagation and TLE comorbidities, including anxiety disorders. Likewise, neuroimaging studies (i.e., fMRI) have demonstrated correlations between emotion regulation and function within this fronto-limbic network. Yet, existing neuroimaging and electrophysiology techniques are limited in their assessment of experimenter-manipulated brain-behavior relationships due to correlational approaches, in addition to poor temporal resolution (1-3 s TR in fMRI) and spatial specificity (broad cortical assessment in EEG). Thus, fronto-limbic sEEG mapping will serve as a valuable assessment of function and connectivity modulating inhibition of emotion responses before and after Pavlovian fear conditioning. By also conducting mental health assessments in these patients, this project will serve as a valuable model for better understanding network function linked to epilepsy, anxiety, and healthy emotion processes.",

Follow-up visits of patients with immune problems may occur at 6 months and at one year after the first visit (or more frequently if medically required) to include:\n\n   * Medical history update\n   * Physical examination\n   * Follow-up on abnormal test results and medical treatments initiated at NIH\n   * Collection of blood, saliva, urine, or wound drainage samples for repeat immune function studies\n   * Tissue study of specimens removed for medical reasons at other institutions besides NIH",
    "Detailed Description": "This protocol is designed for the screening and baseline assessment of and collection of research samples from patients with abnormalities of immune function as manifested by recurrent or unusual infections, recurrent or chronic inflammation, or previous laboratory evidence of immune dysfunction. After baseline assessments are complete, participants will remain on study to allow long-term assessments of the natural course of their condition. Abnormalities of immune function may be inherited or may be iatrogenic such as that following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or other treatments resulting in prolonged immune dysfunction. Blood and/or bone marrow cells may also be used to investigate the utility of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) for immune cell derivation and targeted gene correction. This is not a protocol to study or screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, though patients with HIV infection who may have other causes for immune dysfunction are not excluded. First- or second-degree genetically related family members (limited to mother, father, siblings, grandparents, children, aunts, uncles, and first cousins of an affected patient) may also be screened for clinical, in vitro, and genetic correlates of immune abnormalities. Healthy Volunteers will be enrolled as a source of control blood samples for research testing, not to include genetic testing. Patients with documented immune dysfunction may receive limited medically indicated treatment if that medically indicated treatment is related to the abnormality of immune function under study. Results of clinically indicated diagnostic evaluations and treatments performed outside of this protocol may be collected for research use as part of this study. When screening and assessment is complete, patients will be offered an opportunity to participate in another study, or if there are no active studies appropriate for the patient, other options will be suggested to the primary or referring physician. Regardless of whether the patient enrolls on another NIH study, they will remain on this study for long-term follow-up of their condition.\n\nThis protocol will allow detailed long-term investigation of patients with abnormalities of immune function with the following goals:\n\n1. To determine the degree, scope, and cause of immune dysfunction;\n2. To establish the pace and pattern of change in the disease process;\n3. To determine the extent of organ involvement and damage from immune dysfunction.\n\nThe assessments performed under this protocol are necessary to discover new causes of immune abnormalities, to delineate epidemiology of immune deficiencies, to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and to determine a patient s eligibility for other studies.",

    "Brief Summary": "Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is commonly observed in patients with obesity, primarily due to sequestration by adipose tissue. Recent research highlights the importance of this deficiency, showing a correlation between low vitamin D levels and mechanisms contributing to insulin resistance.\n\nObjectives: This study aims to compare the effects of supplementing with 4,000 IU of vitamin D versus 1,000 IU over six months on insulin resistance and the leptin/adiponectin ratio in school-aged children and adolescents with obesity.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A controlled clinical trial will be conducted involving 40 children with obesity aged 10 to 18 years (BMI \\>95th percentile). Participating children and their parents will undergo measurements such as weight, height, BMI, body fat, and Tanner stage. All participants will receive dietary and physical activity recommendations based on WHO guidelines. After initial assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 4,000 IU or 1,000 IU of vitamin D. They will be monitored monthly for capsule intake and adverse effects, with follow-up measurements of anthropometry, leptin, adiponectin, insulin \\& lipid profile.\n\nStatistical Analysis: Baseline characteristics will be compared using t-Student or U-Mann Whitney tests, depending on variable distribution. The intervention's impact will be assessed by calculating deltas for body fat and biochemical measurements, with significance tested using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests. Covariance analysis (ANCOVA) will be used to adjust for confounding variables.",
    "Detailed Description": "Materials and Methods The study will compare the effect of 4000 IU vitamin D supplementation over six months on adipokines (leptin/adiponectin ratio) and insulin resistance (HOMA index) in school-aged children and adolescents with obesity, against a similar group receiving 1000 IU of vitamin D. The study will be conducted at the Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez and UMAE Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda, Centro M\u00e9dico Nacional Siglo XXI. This controlled clinical trial features an experimental, randomized, double-blind design. The study population includes schoolchildren with obesity attending the Adolescent Clinic at Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico and outpatient services at UMAE Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda.\n\nSampling and Selection Criteria A non-probabilistic sampling will select children identified with obesity. Selection criteria include both male and female patients aged 10 to 18 with obesity as per BMI (\\>95th percentile according to WHO age and sex tables), who agree to participate, and reside in Mexico City. Exclusion criteria exclude patients with comorbidities unrelated to obesity, genetic syndromes, those currently receiving vitamin supplements or pharmacological treatments for obesity, and those with pre-existing insulin resistance requiring pharmacological treatment.\n\nTreatment Arms Group A will receive 4000 IU of vitamin D daily for six months. Group B, the control group, will receive 1000 IU daily. Randomization is managed using a software tool, with treatment assignments sealed in opaque envelopes and administered according to randomized allocation.\n\nSample Size and Statistical Analysis Sample size calculations for unpaired group comparisons anticipate 20 participants per group, adjusting for a 20% dropout rate, based on differences in the leptin/adiponectin ratio and HOMA index. Statistical analyses will be performed on both an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. Descriptive analysis will evaluate quantitative variables' distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine appropriate statistical tests. Comparative analyses will utilize t-tests or U-Mann Whitney tests for quantitative variables, and chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data. Mixed-effects regression models will assess changes in dependent variables over time. Analyses will be conducted using Stata version 14.0, with a confidence level of \u22640.05.\n\nProcedures and Follow-Up Prior to the intervention, patients will undergo comprehensive assessments including anthropometry and blood tests. Dietary and physical activity plans will be provided, tailored to each patient's caloric needs and physical capabilities. Monthly follow-ups will ensure adherence to the supplementation regimen and monitor any adverse effects. The final assessment will repeat all initial evaluations to assess changes after six months of treatment.\n\nBlinding and Data Integrity The study ensures blinding for medical staff, patients, families, and data collectors. The treatment capsules for both groups will be identical in appearance to maintain blinding integrity throughout the trial.\n\nStudy Conclusion The study concludes with a final collection of anthropometric and blood sample data after six months, which will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on improving insulin resistance and adipokine levels among children and adolescents with obesity.",

    "Brief Summary": "This study will compare a new weight loss program that focuses on a healthy eating pattern, with WW\u2122 (formally Weight Watchers), an effective and widely available weight loss program. Study researchers have developed an adapted version of the Mediterranean eating pattern to be more acceptable and realistic for southerners; this adapted version is known as \"Med-South.\" Those who take part in the study will be randomly assigned to either the Med-South weight loss program or WW\u2122. Both programs will last for 2 years with measurement visits at the start of the study and at 4-, 12- and 24-month follow-up. While the primary outcome measured by the trial will be weight loss at 24 months, researchers will collect other data which may show additional health benefits of the Med-South diet. The study team will measure blood markers of inflammation, which are known to improve with better diet quality. Researchers will also measure participants' skin carotenoid levels, which increase with greater fruit and vegetable consumption. The study will be conducted within 2 regional catchment areas (n=360 participants) representing a diverse spectrum of patients and settings. Patients with a BMI \u2265 30 kg/m\\^2 will be enrolled and randomized to intervention or augmented usual care. To assure adequate subgroup representation, \u2265 40% of the sample will have diabetes, \u2265 40% will be male, and \u2265 40% will be African American. The intervention will be delivered in 3 phases over 24 months by research staff: Phase I (4 months) focuses on adopting a Med-style dietary pattern; Phase II (8 months) on weight loss; and Phase III (12 months) on weight loss maintenance. Outcomes will be assessed at 4, 12, and 24 months. The primary outcome is weight loss at 24 months. Secondary outcomes include change in physiologic, behavioral, and psychosocial measures. Researchers will also assess implementation cost and the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to the augmented usual care group.",
    "Detailed Description": "Below, each of the treatment arms is described in detail.\n\nMed-South Weight Loss Program\n\nMost weight loss programs offer weekly one-on-one or group counseling sessions for 16-20 weeks. The Med-South Weight Loss Program is different and is given in 3 phases. The program begins with Phase I, a 4-month lifestyle phase that focuses on the \"basics\" of healthy eating rather than weight loss. Over the next 8 months in Phase II, we focus on weight loss, followed by a year-long (Phase III) phase to help maintain weight loss. In Phase I, the main counseling sessions happen at monthly visits, to which check-in phone calls are added. In Phase II, the main counseling sessions will occur weekly for 6-8 weeks, depending on participants' progress. There are also check in phone calls-the number will vary based on progress. During Phase III, there are 2 main visits and follow-up phone calls. More details about these visits are in the table below.\n\nSome of the counseling visits will be face-to-face with the counselor and some by phone. Only one member of a family may join this study, but other family members are invited to take part in face-to-face and phone counseling sessions. (As of June 2020, due to COVID-19 only one other family member or friend may come with you to in-person visits.) Of the 14 core counseling sessions), the face-to-face format will be required for only 5 (the 1st session of each Phase, after 2 months of the weight loss program, and approximately 1/2 through the year long maintenance phase). (As of June 2020, due to COVID-19, only these visits will be in person. All the others will be by phone or videoconferencing, until further notice based on updated COVID-19 guidelines.) During face-to-face sessions, the participant and the counselor will sit side-by-side and use a web-based program or the paper format to review educational materials, select dietary goals, and list first steps to reach these goals. (As of June 2020, due to COVID-19, counselor and participant will sit more than 6 feet apart and a large wall mounted monitor will be used to review study materials. This protocol will be followed until further notice based on updated COVID-19 guidelines.) If the phone format is used for major counseling sessions, the participant may view the educational content online or use the paper version. The program also includes brief telephone calls to check on progress towards goals selected at previous sessions and provide support for lifestyle change. The number of phone calls will depend on the participant meeting his/her personal weight loss goals in Phase II or keeping the weight off in Phase III. Detail for each Phase is given below.\n\nPhase I\n\n* 8 total contacts\n\n  * 4 core sessions: the first must be in-person; choice of in-person or phone for all others\n  * 4 follow-up phone calls\n* Core session = 45-60 min.\n* Follow-up call = 15 min.\n* total time: 4 - 5 hours\n\nPhase II\n\n* 14 core sessions: the first and third must be in-person; choice of in-person or phone for all others.\n* 6-12 follow-up phone calls\n* Core session (In-person) = 45-60 min.\n* Core session (phone) = 30-45 min.\n* Follow-up call = 20-30 min. Total time 8.7 - 14 hours (core) 4.7 - 9.5 hours (Follow-up)\n\nPhase III\n\n* 2 core sessions (both in-person)\n* 12-24 follow-up phone calls (1-2 per month)\n* Core session (In-person) = 45-60 min.\n* Follow-up call = 15-20 min. Total time 1.25 - 2 hours (Core) 3 - 8 hours (Follow-up)\n\n  2-Year Program TOTAL 44 - 60 Contacts -- 21.7 - 38.5 hours\n\nWW\u2122 Weight Loss Program\n\nThose randomized to WW\u2122 will have access to both the Workshop and Digital components of the WW\u2122 program for 2 years. WW offers in-person coaching and community-based learning through weekly Workshops at WW Studios.The Workshop component allows for attending weekly group meeting at a WW\u2122 studio (local WW\u2122 office). (As of June 2020, due to COVID-19, the workshop component will be available in a virtual videoconferencing \\[Zoom\u2122\\] format until further notice based on updated COVID-19 guidelines.)\n\nThe Digital component can be accessed using the WW\u2122 website or the smart phone App. The digital tools available thought the WW Digital program include food tracking (either manually or with bar code scanning), progress charts, lifestyle coaching with 24/7 chat with a WW Coach, ability to track activity (manually or by syncing a fitness tracking device), incentives for behavior change (WellnessWins), recipes, and even local restaurant recommendations using GPS. Those in the WW group will also have access to Connect, WW's members-only digital community.\n\nThe WW\u2122 program uses \"SmartPoints\" assigned to foods based on energy content and nutritional value, allocating a certain number of points to users daily based on their starting weight, weight loss goals, age and sex. Participants will receive a personalized SmartPoints budget made up of Daily SmartPoints, plus some extra Weekly SmartPoints for those days when a cushion is needed.",

People with AUD may drink compulsively or feel like they cannot control their alcohol use. Acamprosate is an FDA-approved drug that reduces anxiety and craving in some, but not all, people with AUD.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn more about how acamprosate affects brain function in people with AUD.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 21 to 65 years with moderate to severe AUD.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will stay in the clinic for 21 days after a detoxification period of approximately 7 days.\n\nAcamprosate is a capsule taken by mouth. Half of participants will take this drug 3 times a day with meals. The other half will take a placebo. The placebo looks like the study drug but does not contain any medicine. Participants will not know which capsules they are taking.\n\nParticipants will have a procedure called electroencephalography (EEG): A gel will be applied to certain locations on their scalp, and a snug cap will be placed on their head. The cap has sensors with wires. The sensors detect electrical activity in the brain. Participants will lie still and perform 2 tasks: they will look at different shapes and press a button when they see a specific one; and they will listen to tones and press dedicated buttons when they hear the corresponding tones.\n\nParticipants will have 2 EEGs: 1 on day 2 and 1 on day 23 of their study participation. They may opt to have up to 4 more EEG studies (one on day 13 and one on each of the three follow-up visits) and 2 sleep studies, in which they would have sensors attached to their scalp while they sleep.\n\nParticipants may have up to three follow-up visits for 6 months.",

Known and established electroencephalogram (EEG) markers of AUD as well as anxiety and alcohol craving levels will be assessed pre- and post-treatment. We hypothesize that acamprosate normalizes EEG markers associated with AUD beyond placebo, specifically, reduces beta power, increases alpha power, does not change slow band (delta and theta) power in resting EEG; and reduces theta event-related synchronization (ERS), and amplifies and hastens P300 waveforms in event-related potentials (ERPs).\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To test, via within-subject comparisons, whether a 21-day acamprosate treatment regimen normalizes the EEG of AUD inpatients beyond placebo in reducing beta power, increasing alpha power, and changing slow band (delta and theta) power in resting EEG; and reducing theta event-related synchronization (ERS), and amplifying and hastening P300 waveforms in event-related potentials (ERPs).\n\nSecondary Objectives: 1) To correlate EEG changes with clinical changes, such as anxiety and alcohol craving. 2) To determine polysomnographic markers of response to acamprosate. 3) To correlate polysomnographic markers with clinical changes, such as anxiety and alcohol craving.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: The said markers of EEG power and higher order EEG patterns will be measured before and after the 21-day treatment to compare the active-medication and placebo groups.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: 1) Acamprosate-induced changes in EEG power and higher order EEG patterns will be correlated to changes in anxiety and alcohol craving. 2) Acamprosate-induced changes in EEG power will be correlated to changes in polysomnographic markers such as total sleep time, slow wave sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and total wake duration after sleep onset. 3) Changes in polysomnographic markers will be correlated to changes in anxiety and alcohol craving.",

    "Detailed Description": "Study Description:\n\nClinical health outcomes and the likelihood of post stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID) can greatly vary following stroke incidence. Thus, developing a better understanding of what characteristics might provide resilience and enrich post-stroke recovery is of utmost importance. The NINDS Natural History of Stroke study (01N0007) was designed with the intention to generate natural history data of participants with or at-risk for acute stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and other disturbances of cerebrovascular circulation. Through use of participants enrolled in the Natural History of Stroke study within the past six years, we aim to characterize social determinants of health (SDOH) and present-day cognitive function in this cohort. Following the collection of these data, we will examine how the core volume of acute supratentorial infarcts relates to post-stroke function as measured by the NIHSS, and how this association is modified based upon SDOH features and independent of treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To characterize SDOH and assess if such characteristics modify the relationship between MRI core infarct volume and post-stroke function (i.e., NIHSS) at baseline and/or discharge. Resilience will thus be assessed by evaluating how specified SDOH modify the correlation between MRI core infarct volume and NIHSS.\n* To assess present cognitive function and assess if SDOH modify the relationship between MRI core infarct volume and present-day cognition. Resilience will thus be assessed by evaluating how SDOH modify the correlation between infarct volume and present-day cognition.\n* To assess if SDOH modify the relationship between poststroke function (i.e. NIHSS) at baseline and/or discharge with present-day cognition. Resilience will thus be assessed by evaluating how SDOH modify the correlation between NIHSS and present-day cognition.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to assess SDOH and cognitive function in participants who have had a stroke in the past six years. To this end, the primary study outcomes will be post-stroke function as defined by NIHSS and present-day cognitive function.\n\n* Primary Endpoint: Association between MRI core infarct volume and post-stroke function (i.e. NIHSS) as modified by SDOH.\n* Secondary Endpoints: Association between MRI core infarct volume and present-day cognitive function as modified by SDOH.\n* Exploratory Endpoint: Association between post-stroke function (i.e. NIHSS) and present-day cognitive function as modified by SDOH.",

    "Detailed Description": "A disaster can be defined as a significant disturbance in the operation and well-being of a community resulting from the convergence of hazardous events with factors such as exposure, and vulnerability. Disasters are grouped into two main categories: natural disasters and technological disasters. Many individuals who survive these disasters face an increased risk of psychological distress and psychopathology, including depressive disorders or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD symptoms include intrusion symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, arousal and reactivity, or even dissociation. However, as well as being directly exposed to the event, trauma can be indirect by witnessing the event experienced by others and the impact of indirect trauma can be just as significant as that of direct trauma. Family members, friends, neighbours, coworkers, and professionals assisting the primary victims may also undergo similar traumatic symptoms. Many professionals from various fields, such as doctors, nurses, first responders, and mental health workers, are dedicated to helping disaster survivors' short-term and long-term needs. Therefore, they experience similar symptoms of survivors, including re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of reminders of the event, detachment from others, irritability, and persistent arousal like difficulty sleeping. The development of these symptoms due to close contact with the survivor is called secondary traumatic stress (STS). After disasters, it is important to consider the mental health of people who are secondarily exposed to trauma and those who experience the trauma.\n\nPsychological distress refers to an individual's distinct unpleasant emotional state when confronted with a particular stressor, which subsequently damages the person. It is frequently used to describe a wide range of symptoms, including depression and general anxiety symptoms as well as personality traits and behavioral issues. After an exposure to a disaster, many individuals encounter mental health challenges and are more susceptible to developing psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These syndromes result in psychological distress and dysfunctionalities in the individual's psychosocial and occupational lives. The symptoms can be seen not only in people who experienced the disaster but also in those who communicated with them. Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) workers face a distinct aspect of their job, which involves being exposed to their clients' experiences of trauma. They introduce interventions in areas such as health, education, abuse and violence, and emergencies to help survivors to deal with the mental health impacts of those experiences. Therefore, MHPSS workers are at risk for developing symptoms of secondary traumatization and psychological distress.\n\nOn February 6, 2023, two major earthquakes with magnitudes of 7.7 and 7.6 struck T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, centered in Kahramanmara\u015f, T\u00fcrkiye. Over the course of one month, various numbers of aftershocks continued. This catastrophic event affected approximately 13 million people in 11 Turkish provinces. 50,783 Turkish citizens died and countless individuals lost their loved ones, their homes, and their jobs. This disaster inflicted immense suffering on people in the country, and they had to deal with many major life-changing impacts and issues. The earthquake affected not only the people in the region but also those who went to the region to offer help, and those who observed the unfolding events. Psychosocial support institutions and mental health professionals were some of the ones who went to the region to assist. Interventions should be designed for mental health professionals regarding the secondary traumatization they might encounter in the aftermath of the earthquake.\n\nSkills for Adjustment and Resilience (SOLAR) Program was formed by a team consisting of 21 experts from around the world with expertise in trauma, disaster mental health, and disaster response, representing the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and Asia. It was designed for the need for practical interventions to address the psychosocial needs of trauma and disaster survivors with subclinical mental health issues. The SOLAR program was intended to be efficient, adaptable in various settings, and easily applicable for trained laypersons and professionals to reach more people with subclinical distress following a traumatic event. It also has a trauma processing unit specifically designed for traumatized individuals. Each session lasts 50 minutes, except for the first session, which is 80 minutes and is delivered face-to-face over five weeks. The SOLAR program was effective in the pilot study with 15 bushfire survivors in Australia (O'Donnell et al., 2020). Furthermore, its effectiveness in reducing depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in a group format was also confirmed with 79 people in Tuvalu affected by Tropical Cyclone Pam. Lastly, the program was feasible and useful for improving coping with traumatic events among German trauma survivors with persistent subclinical distress.\n\nThis study aims to provide the feasibility of a culturally adapted version of the SOLAR program among MHPSS workers who provide psychological or psychosocial support to the survivors of the earthquakes on February 6, 2023, in T\u00fcrkiye. As an intervention program, SOLAR aims to examine subclinical distress and adjustment problems following a traumatic experience, in this case, an earthquake. The primary inquiry of this study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the SOLAR group program within an open trial among 20 MHPSS workers in the aftermath of a trauma. In addition to the feasibility, the study aims to decrease participants' distress levels as the primary outcome and their secondary traumatization, depression, and anxiety levels as secondary outcomes.\n\nGiven the information above, the hypotheses of the current study are as follows:\n\n* The SOLAR Group Program will be feasible and effective among MHPSS workers who have experiences with survivors of the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye\n* The SOLAR Group Program will reduce psychological distress at the post-test and follow-up compared to the pre-test.\n* The SOLAR Group Program will reduce secondary traumatic stress at the post-test and follow-up compared to the pre-test.\n* The SOLAR Group Program will reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms at the post-test and follow-up compared to the pre-test.\n\nFirst, they will receive a consent form for the participation. Upon accepting it, they will fill out a demographic form, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and Assessment of Suicidal Thoughts for the screening. People with scores over 20 on this scale, 18 years of age or above, and MHPSS workers who have no suicidal risk will be included in the study. Before the SOLAR, the intervention program, participants will be asked to complete The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) if they approve participation in these surveys. STSS will be used to measure secondary traumatic stress symptoms that they are experiencing. While GAD-7 will be used to measure anxiety, PHQ-9 will be used to measure depression. It will take approximately 20 minutes to attend these surveys. After collecting their pre-test scores, they will receive the SOLAR intervention program.\n\nThe SOLAR intervention program was translated and adapted to Turkish by a group of psychologists. Participants will be provided with a workbook that includes topics of the sessions and practice tools of the contents for each session. The content of the workbook includes strategies for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, managing distressing emotions, coming to terms with disaster experiences, getting back to usual activities, and dealing with worry and negative thoughts. The program will be delivered by coaches in weekly sessions for 5 weeks. Each session lasts 50 minutes, except for the first session which is 80 minutes. Coaches will be people who took part in the Turkish adaptation of the program, and they will follow the coach manual. After 5 weeks, post-test scores of the same scales will be assessed. The same scales will be used at the follow-up one month after post-test. There will be no control group in this study.\n\nSince this is a feasibility study, the feasibility outcomes will also be assessed and reported by eligibility rate, recruitment speed, treatment adherence, dropout rate, and process evaluation interview. In this interview, participants will be asked about how they found the intervention in general, how they found the coaches, and their feedback on aspects that could be improved. The informed consent for the process evaluation interview will also be collected from the participants. These interviews will be administered by another researcher other than the coaches conducting the study. The data analysis will be conducted using SPSS.",

    "Brief Summary": "Background:\n\nA heart catheterization is a diagnostic heart procedure used to measure pressures and take pictures of the blood flow through the heart chambers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluoroscopy shows continuous pictures of the heart chambers that doctors can watch while they work. Researchers want to test this procedure with catheterization tools routinely used in x-ray catheterization called guidewires. Guidewires will help move the heart catheter through the different heart chambers. Guidewires are usually considered unsafe during MRI because MRI can cause a guidewire to heat while inside the blood vessels and heart. Researchers are testing special low energy MRI settings that allow certain guidewires to be used during MRI catheterization without heating. Using these guidewires during MRI may help to decrease the amount of time you are in the MRI scanner, and the overall time the MRI catheterization procedure takes.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo test if certain MRI settings make it safe to use a guidewire during MRI fluoroscopy.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults 18 and older whose doctors have recommended right heart catheterization.\n\nDesign:\n\nResearchers will screen participants by reviewing their lab results and questionnaire answers.\n\nParticipants may give 4 blood samples.\n\nParticipants will be sedated. They will have a tube (catheter) placed in the groin, arm, or neck if they don t already have one.\n\nPatches on the skin will monitor heart rhythm. Special antennas, covered in pads, will be placed against the body.\n\nParticipants will lie flat on a table that slides in and out of the MRI scanner as it makes pictures. Participants will get earplugs for the loud knocking noise. They can talk on an intercom. They will be inside the scanner for up to 2 hours. They can ask to stop at any time.\n\nDuring a heart catheterization, catheters will be inserted through the tubes already in place. The catheters are guided by MRI fluoroscopy into the chambers of the heart and vessels. The guidewire will help position the catheter.\n\n...",
    "Detailed Description": "Heart catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure to measure pressure into specific heart cavities. Heart catheterization usually uses X-ray guidance, which involves radiation exposure, and which fails to visualize soft tissue. For several years, real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluoroscopy has been the standard technique to guide right heart catheterization at the NIH clinical center.\n\nGuidewires are standard tools used to steer catheters through the body and heart. Guidewires have not been used during MRI fluoroscopy catheterization because of the risk of heating. We have developed MRI techniques that do not risk heating using specific commercial guidewires. In this protocol we will use this new low-energy real-time MRI fluoroscopy technique to enable use of guidewires during otherwise standard MRI catheterization of the right side of the heart through veins, and of the left side of the heart through the aorta.\n\nIn the second phase of the protocol, we will begin performing systematic MRI guidewire heart catheterization without X-ray whenever possible. We will assess the heart s response to hemodynamic provocation during MRI catheterization tailored to the patient s problem. We will use this protocol to further refine the technique.\n\nThis will enable future testing of devices for adult and pediatric MRI-fluoroscopy catheterization, which may lead to new non-surgical treatments of cardiovascular disease.",

    "Brief Summary": "Background:\n\nThe North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study (EPS) was held from 1982 to 1986. Women who were trying to get pregnant took part in the study. They collected urine samples. They kept diaries. They filled out surveys. They answered questions about their partners. They were asked about their drug use. Data about air pollution and other exposures were also collected. A follow-up study was held from 2010 to 2011. Researchers want to use the data and samples to study factors that affect reproductive success.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo examine behavioral and environmental exposures and reproductive health, such as menstrual cycles, conception, pregnancy loss, and pregnancy outcomes.\n\nEligibility:\n\nThe 221 healthy women age 21-42 who were planning to get pregnant and took part in the 1982-86 North Carolina EPS at the time they stopped using all birth control. A 2010-11 follow-up included 173 of these women.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis study uses existing data. No new data will be collected in this study.\n\nStored urine samples may be used. Data from surveys and other sources will be used. All of the women who gave data and samples will be included.\n\nElectronic data is held in secure databases.

    "Detailed Description": "Existing self-reported data and assay results from the 1982-1986 North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study (EPS) and a subsequent 2010-2011 cohort follow-up study will be used to examine predictors of fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Some of these data will be harmonized with data from other studies by our collaborator (Harville PI, Tulane University) to examine factors, such as marijuana use in women and their partners, influencing reproductive success, including (but not limited to) conception, pregnancy loss, and birth outcomes. Women enrolled in the original EPS study after discontinuing birth control and were followed for the occurrence of a pregnancy. Participants completed daily diaries and collected first morning urine specimens which allowed the identification of hormonal endpoints. Thus, each woman s time to pregnancy was prospectively measured. In the EPS Follow-up study, women completed a questionnaire that included their recall of their time to pregnancy during the study. This allowed analysis of two major questions, one regarding the recall of time- to-pregnancy, and the other regarding the natural length of gestation. Several exposure metrics based on address geolocation data were calculated, including the distance from residence to nearest major road, air pollution and related exposures, light at night, and other exposures. Existing urine specimens can be assayed for numerous environmental contaminants including metals, pesticides, and drug metabolites (both over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen and drugs of abuse like marijuana or opioids). Urine specimens can also be used to examine nutritional markers such as phytoestrogen exposure and caffeine metabolites. Additional hormone measures may also be possible as metabolomics and technology improve. Thus, the stored EPS specimens can be leveraged to answer multiple, relevant fertility research questions. Women in the original tudy answered questions regarding their tobacco smoking and marijuana smoking. In addition, partners of the women were asked the same series of questions regarding tobacco and marijuana use.\n\nWe intend to use all of this existing data, assay results, and to perform additional urine assays, to examine factors influencing reproductive success, including (but not limited to) conception, pregnancy loss, and birth outcomes. To address some of these questions, de-identified data from the Early Pregnancy Study will be harmonized with data from other studies in the Preconception Period Analysis of Risks and Exposures Influencing Health and Development (PrePARED) consortium. Further, de-identified data and specimens will be shared with Dr. Ashley Boggs and colleagues to address the objectives below. Data and specimens will be shared with other qualified investigators in the future to address relevant research questions.",

Antibodies are a type of protein that helps the body fight infection and are usually made by a person's own immune system. A type of antibody that can recognize and block many types of HIV from entering healthy cells are called broadly neutralizing antibodies, or 'bnAbs', and may also activate other immune cells to help destroy HIV-infected cells. Research has shown that people with HIV who develop bnAbs against the virus are better able to control the infection. While the immune systems of some people with HIV show signs of early bnAb production, only a small percentage of people with HIV naturally develop bnAbs.\n\nApproximately 32 participants will be sequentially enrolled and randomized 3:1 by chance like rolling dice to receive either the Trimer 4571 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that does not contain Trimer 4571.\n\nParticipants will be asked to attend 11 study visits over a period of approximately 50 weeks and receive 3 doses of their assigned study vaccine: one at Entry, one at Week 8 and one at Week 20.

Each cycle is 28 days. They can take the drug until they have bad side effects, their CCA gets worse, or if they become pregnant. They will record their blood pressure twice daily at home. They will also keep a medication diary of each dose of tivozanib they take and any side effects.\n\nParticipants will have study visits before starting each new cycle and every 8 weeks. They will also have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends at NIH, or if they are unable to come to NIH by phone, videocall, or other NIH-approved platform. Then they will be contacted 6 and 12 months later, and then once a year.\n\n...",
    "Detailed Description": "Background:\n\nBiliary Tract Cancers (BTC) (cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and gallbladder cancer (GBC)) are aggressive malignancies that remain a clinical challenge with limited treatment options and poor survival. Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is the most validated first-line treatment, but the response rate approaches only 22% and median progression free survival is 8 months.\n\nCytoplasmic accumulation of the nuclear export protein exportin 7, XPO7, portends poor outcomes for patients with biliary tract cancer. Using pre-clinical models, we established XPO7 as an oncogenic driver in CCA cells and determined that this biology is driven by the interaction between XPO7 and a hitherto incompletely studied kinase, Ste-20 like kinase (SLK).\n\nXPO7 binds to and promotes cytoplasmic localization and stabilization of SLK, which in turn activates oncogenic signaling. Targeting SLK expression via short hairpin RNA abrogates tumor formation in 3D culture and mice models, establishing SLK as a novel\n\ntarget in biliary tract cancer.\n\nThe pan-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor tivozanib demonstrated activity against SLK in our in vitro screen, which we later confirmed with x-ray crystallography. Tivozanib abrogated growth of CCA tumorspheres, resulting in substantial tumor regression using murine xenograft models and patient-derived xenografts. Additionally, we evaluated tivozanib in our ex vivo tumor platform using a liver metastasis from a patient with XPO7-expressing biliary tract cancer and documented tumor cell apoptosis.\n\nAs reliable, molecular-targeted regimens either for first- or second-line therapy for the majority of patients with biliary tract cancer have remained elusive, these results support evaluation of tivozanib as a treatment option for patients with biliary tract cancer.\n\nObjectives:\n\nDetermine the overall response rate (RECIST) of tivozanib in participants with biliary tract cancer (BTC) who were previously treated with first-line therapy.\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants with histologically or cytologically confirmed biliary tract cancer (BTC) not amenable to resection\n\nPrevious treatment with 1st line chemotherapy\n\nAge \\>= 18 years of age\n\nECOG performance status of \\<=2\n\nPreserved hepatic function\n\nAdequate organ and marrow function\n\nDesign:\n\nOpen-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase II study\n\nTrial is a Simon minimax two-stage Phase II trial design to determine efficacy.\n\nTreatment is in cycles of 28 days, 3 weeks on, 1 week off (with possible dose de-escalation if needed). Treatment evaluations for efficacy will be every 2 months (8 weeks).\n\nUp to 21 participants may receive study intervention on this protocol",

Digital biomarkers are based on (i) continuously collected real-time data, during the patient's day to day activities; and (ii) task-based assessment. In this study the investigators are interested in developing algorithms for the detection of disease progression in PSP patients in key clinical parameters: bradykinesia, gait, rising from a chair and falls, based on (i) sensor data obtained by means of passive monitoring during daily living; and (ii) sensor data collected during the Virtual Motor Exam.",
    "Detailed Description": "Rationale In light of the advent of a wide range of new disease modifying treatments, and acknowledging that existing clinical outcome measures may well be insufficiently sensitive to detecting small but potentially clinically relevant changes in the disease course, there is an urgent need for development of digital progression biomarkers, not only in the field of Parkinson's disease, but also in the field of the various forms of atypical parkinsonism, including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).\n\nStudy Design Prospective, longitudinal, single-center cohort study.\n\nStudy Objectives The primary objective is to develop algorithms for the detection of disease progression in PSP patients in key clinical parameters: bradykinesia, gait, rising from a chair and falls, based on (1) sensor data obtained by means of passive monitoring during daily living; and (2) sensor data collected during the Virtual Motor Exam.\n\nThe second objective of this study is to create a longitudinal dataset describing the clinical and functional characteristics of a representative PSP cohort to allow researchers to investigate important unanswered questions in PSP.\n\nStudy population 50 patients with possible or probable PSP, according to established international criteria (i.e., MDS-PSP criteria); diagnosis confirmed by consensus review of a videotaped neurological examination by two neurologists with deep expertise in movement disorders. In addition, we will include 50 age and gender matched healthy controls.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints The primary study endpoints are the annual changes in the newly developed digital measurements, extracted from the Verily Study Watch. Secondary endpoints include standardized evaluations for motor, cognition, neuropsychological, quality of life and ADL assessments. Additionally, whole blood for DNA and serum will be collected in the PSP subjects, to use for e.g. genotyping and phenotyping.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness For data collection, the study assessor will visit each participant at home twice within an interval of 1 year \u00b1 60 days. All study assessments are routine exams done in standard clinical practice and are generally well tolerated, which takes up to 2 hours each time. PSP subjects will also be asked to consent to a blood draw once. During their 1-year participation, each participant will wear the Verily Study Watch daily for up to 23 hours. This small, unobtrusive electronic device is easily worn and poses no significant safety risk. All participants will be asked to complete a set scheduled tasks twice a day, once a week, which altogether takes 15-20 minutes of their time.\n\nAs data collection is not performed for immediate diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, there will be no direct benefits for the subjects enrolled in this study. Patients may indirectly benefit from the study, as their data contribute to providing novel etiological insights for improving the use of existing treatments, developing of new therapeutic approaches, and increasing the precision of personalized disease management.",

    "Brief Summary": "This study will evaluate clinical and laboratory tests that might be useful in determining if an investigational drug can slow the progression of Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C (NPC), a genetic disorder that results in progressive loss of nervous system function. The study will: 1) look for a clinical or biochemical marker that can be used as a measure of response to treatment, and 2) define the rate of progression of biochemical marker abnormalities in a group of NPC patients who will later be invited to enroll in a treatment trial.\n\nPatients of any age with NPC may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures every 6 months during 4- to 5-day admissions at the NIH Clinical Center.\n\n* Medical evaluation, including medical history, physical exam, neurological exam, neuropsychometric evaluation, and blood and urine tests.\n* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord, is obtained for study. After administration of a local anesthetic, a small needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.\n* Eye exam and eye movement study: The pupils of the eye are dilated to examine the structures of the eyes. For the eye movement study a special contact lens is placed on the eye and the patient looks at a series of target light spots moving on a screen.\n* Hearing tests.\n* Electroretinography (in patients who can cooperate with the test) to measure the function of the retina. Before the test, the patient's pupils are dilated and an electrode (small silver disk) is taped to the forehead. The patient sits in a dark room for 30 minutes and then a special contact lens is placed on one eye after it has been numbed with drops. The contact lens senses small electrical signals generated by the retina when lights flash. During the ERG recording, the eye is stimulated with flashes of light projected inside a hollow sphere. After the test, a full eye exam is done and photographs of the retina are taken.\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain and obtain information about brain chemicals. The patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. Patients who cannot remain still in the scanner may be sedated for the test.\n* Psychometric testing: Patients complete questionnaires.\n* Photographs of the patient may be taken for use in teaching sessions or scientific presentations or publications, with the patient's consent. Patients may be recognizable, but are not identified by name.\n* Pregnancy test in all female patients over 10 years of age at the beginning of each admission to the Clinical Center.",
    "Detailed Description": "Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and gangliosides. NPC is a rare (estimated prevalence of 1:120,000-150,000) neurodegenerative disorder with a wide clinical spectrum and a variable age of onset. Classically, children with NPC demonstrate neurological dysfunction with cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, seizures, vertical gaze palsy, motor impairment, dysphagia, psychotic episodes, and progressive dementia. In general, adolescent and adult onset forms have a more insidious onset and slower progression.\n\nThere is no effective treatment for NPC and it is a lethal disorder. A major impediment to the testing of therapeutic interventions is the lack of well-defined outcome measures. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain both baseline and rate of progression data on clinical and biochemical markers that may later be used as an outcome measure in a clinical trial.",

    "Brief Summary": "Patients who have had a previous allograft failure represent a major problem for transplant centers as they are highly-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitized and unlikely to receive another transplant without significant desensitization. This single center, phase I/II, open label single-arm exploratory study focuses on enrolling twenty patients (ages 15-75) who will begin desensitization therapy to achieve HLA incompatible (HLAi) renal transplantation. Patients who qualify will receive up to 6 doses of clazakizumab 25 mg monthly pre-transplantation. If patients receive an HLAi transplant during the study, the participants will continue to receive another 6 monthly doses of clazakizumab 25 mg, followed by a 6 month protocol biopsy. Patients will continue another 6 doses over 6 months if improvements are seen after the 6th dose of clazakizumab. Patients who develop evidence of persistent allograft dysfunction may have non-protocol biopsies for cause. Patients who receive 12 doses of clazakizumab post-transplant will receive a 12M protocol biopsy.",
    "Detailed Description": "This is a single center, Phase I/II, open label single-arm exploratory study. The trial will primarily examine the safety and tolerability of clazakizumab given after consented and eligible patients begin desensitization therapy to achieve HLAi renal transplantation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 20 subjects (ages 15 to 75) who are highly-HLA sensitized (HS) as determined by the cPRA \u226550% and are eligible for desensitization will be evaluated. All patients will be accrued from the renal transplant program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Once desensitization begins, anti-HLA antibodies will be assessed which are associated with ABMR and/or graft loss. HLA antibodies will be detected using solid phase assay systems currently utilized at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center HLA Laboratory. These anti-HLA antibodies may result naturally or from previous pregnancy, transfusions, or prior transplants. Patients treated with clazakizumab x 6 doses for desensitization will have blood sampling for HLA antibodies, and other monitoring blood samples as well as immunologic studies as outlined. If patients receive an HLAi transplant during the study, participants will receive the standard post-transplant immunosuppressive protocol, and clazakizumab 25 mg SC Q4W X 6 doses with immune monitoring as indicated.\n\nImmune monitoring in blood samples for Treg, Tfh, Th17 and B-cell subsets as well as IL-6 and CRP monitoring will be carried out at the Cedars-Sinai Transplant Immunology Laboratory.\n\nPatients identified as study participants will be HS and listed for HLAi renal transplantation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Cedars-Sinai is a major U.S. desensitization center and performs \\~80 HLAi renal transplants per-year. \\~ 100 new HS patients are referred to Cedars-Sinai each year as potential candidates for desensitization. Eligible patients entering the study will initially receive PLEX (5-7 sessions) + IVIG and receive clazakizumab 25 mg SC one week post-IVIG. If no safety/tolerability/efficacy issues are observed after the initial dose, patients will receive 5 additional injections Q4W. If patients receive an HLAi transplant, clazakizumab will be continued for 6M post- transplant at 25mg SC Q4W for 6 doses (starting at Day 5 post-transplant). A protocol biopsy will be performed at 6M post-transplant to assess the allograft for evidence of ABMR, including C4d staining and TG using Banff 2015 criteria. Patients will continue another 6 doses over 6 months if improvements are seen after the 6th dose of clazakizumab. Patients who develop evidence of persistent allograft dysfunction may have non-protocol biopsies for cause. Patients who receive 12 doses of clazakizumab post-transplant will receive a 12M protocol biopsy. In the event a patient does not show improvement after receiving 6 doses of clazakizumab, no further treatment will be given and the patient will return at Day 365 for a final study visit. All subjects will be evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis. The subject accrual rate will be limited to no more than 1-2 subjects per month in the initial three months to assure safety to all subjects. Repeat laboratories will be performed at the completion of clazakizumab therapy to determine effect on levels and correlation with any potential events.\n\nThe subjects will be followed to determine if the use of clazakizumab for desensitization in this high risk transplant population is safe and without infectious risks. In addition, the investigators will determine the effects of clazakizumab treatment on HLA antibodies in efforts to improve access to HLAi transplants for these individuals. The investigators have previously reported acceptance criteria for HLAi kidney transplants. Renal biopsy assessments will be performed at 6M (per protocol) and 12M (for those who received 12 doses of therapy). The investigators will assess the transplanted patients to determine the number who sustain a viable and functioning kidney allograft as well. All subjects will be evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis. The subject accrual rate will be limited to no more than 1-2 subjects per month in the initial three months to assure safety to all subjects.",

Thus, our goal of the CII-ANiA is to identify the brain (structural and functional), behavioral, genetic, and other phenotypic factors that are associated with alcoholism.\n\nStudy population\n\nNon-treatment seeking adult volunteers and inpatient participants with alcohol use disorder (AUDs). Inpatient AUDs refer to individuals diagnosed with alcohol dependence based on DSM-IV-RT criteria or Alcohol Use Disorder as determined by DSM-5 criteria.\n\nDesign\n\nThis study will require one or more visit(s) that will include MRI scan(s) (if the participant is determined eligible) consisting of a whole brain structural MRI, Diffusion Tensor MRI, Resting State functional MRI (rs-fMRI), several task-based functional MRIs, while performing computerized motivational, cognitive, and emotional tasks.\n\nOutcome measures\n\nOutcome measures of interest include differences in brain structural data and in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals collected cross-sectionally and/or longitudinally at various stages of alcohol use disorder. Imaging outcomes will be measured with standard techniques and analyzed using established image analysis approaches and software tools such as AFNI, SPM, FSL, DTI Studio, etc. In this effort, we will also utilize BOLD signals elicited by each task which have been shown to be associated with various aspects of neurocircuitries in the phases of addiction. To this end, the outcome measures of interest will include, but will not be not limited to, BOLD signals for the binge/intoxication phase in the nucleus accumbens, thalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; for the withdrawal/negative emotionality phase in the amygdala, hippocampus, and ventral striatum; and for the preoccupation/anticipation phase in the prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. Other primary outcome measures include structural and functional connectivity in salience, default mode, and executive control networks associated with the above-mentioned addiction phases, respectively. Secondary outcome measures include comparisons of the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to imaging and behavioral data acquired across other protocols.",

    "Brief Summary": "This randomized controlled trial will take place in up to 15 community health centers across the state of Illinois. Researchers will be studying S.A.F.E. Firearm, a program that aims to increase secure storage of firearms in homes with children. Specifically, S.A.F.E. Firearm includes a brief conversation between pediatric clinicians and parents about secure firearm storage and an offer of a free cable firearm lock within the well-child visit. Researchers will also study a package of strategies to help pediatric clinics incorporate this new practice. The strategies include training for clinic personnel and facilitation, or tailored problem-solving support.\n\nThe questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n* How effective is the package of strategies at helping pediatric clinics adopt this new practice?\n* How effective is the S.A.F.E. Firearm program at changing parents' and guardians' firearm storage behavior?\n\nSome parents and guardians will be invited to complete a brief survey after their visit about their experiences receiving S.A.F.E. Firearm. Some community health center personnel will also be invited to complete an interview about their experiences with S.A.F.E. Firearm and the package of strategies.",
    "Detailed Description": "While some large health systems have successfully adopted secure firearm storage programs such as S.A.F.E. Firearm into routine practice, there is limited research on the implementation of secure firearm storage programs in community settings, such as community health centers, which serve large populations of Americans. These settings often face challenges such as financial pressures and high staff turnover, which were made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, before deploying a secure firearm storage program in this new setting, adaptation is needed. As part of Aim 1 of the grant funding this project, the research team is working with local community-based organizations, firearm safety experts, community health center personnel, and parents and guardians (hereafter, \"parents\") to understand the changes that need to be made to the S.A.F.E. Firearm program and the package of implementation strategies that have been successfully used in previous studies to help pediatric clinics adopt this new practice (training, facilitation, other strategies selected in tandem with partners in the adaptation process). The research team will incorporate needed changes before the present trial will begin.\n\nIn the present study, the research team will conduct a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation trial to test the effect of the adapted S.A.F.E. Firearm program and associated strategies. The trial will be conducted across pediatric well-visits in community health centers across the state of Illinois using a stepped wedge design. Clinics will be randomized into clusters of clinics and the implementation approach (staff training, facilitation, other strategies selected in tandem with partners in the adaptation process) will be activated upon the start of each step.\n\nAims for the study include:\n\nAim 2. We will conduct a pragmatic hybrid type III stepped wedge effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial with community health centers across Illinois to test the effectiveness of our adapted implementation approach (training and facilitation emphasizing S.A.F.E. Firearm delivery) on parent-reported receipt of S.A.F.E. Firearm (i.e., reach; primary implementation outcome). We will also assess secondary implementation outcomes (stage of implementation, cost, acceptability) and effectiveness outcomes (parent firearm storage behavior).\n\nAim 3. We will use mixed methods to identify mechanisms. First, we will conduct interviews to understand constituent perspectives on implementation mechanisms and equitable intervention receipt. Second, we will evaluate reach and firearm storage behavior by demographic characteristics and social determinants of health.",

    "Detailed Description": "Various formulas are used to predict the inner diameter (ID) of the ETT tube whether uncuffed or cuffed based on weight, age, height, and finger size. The accuracy of these formulas is questionable. These formulas depend on the child's demographic characteristics assuming that he/she has normal growth and development and cannot be applied to children with altered growth and development. Moreover, these formulas predict the ID of the ETT ignoring the tube thickness and the OD of the selected tube.\n\nultrasound has recently been identified as an accurate alternative to these formulas. The US-measured epiphyseal diameter of the distal radius is a method that has been recently introduced as a surrogate for the tracheal diameter. The issue is that the size of the airway can be considered a reflection of the body's growth, assuming that the growth rates of the cartilage all over the body are closely related to each other. Therefore, the measurement of the growth of the bony cartilage of the hand can be considered a surrogate marker of the tracheal diameter.9 The extent to which ultrasonography by this method can succeed in predicting the optimal pediatric ETT size remains under investigation.",

    "Detailed Description": "I. Research Background Respiratory diseases, such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis and other chronic respiratory inflammatory diseases, are major global health problems. WHO data shows respiratory diseases are the world's second - leading cause of death, with rising incidence. These diseases, marked by chronic inflammation, airway obstruction and increased airway reactivity, severely affect patients' quality of life. Traditional treatments include inhaled corticosteroids, long - acting bronchodilators and systemic medications. While effective in symptom control and disease progression, they have limitations like systemic side - effects and low drug deposition efficiency from inhalers.\n\nUltrasonic rock salt aerosol inhalation therapy uses ultrasonic atomization to convert salt solution into tiny aerosol particles, with advantages like high efficiency, micro - moisture, dry aerosol properties, and physiological effects such as enhanced clearance and anti - inflammation.\n\nIt has been preliminarily applied in respiratory disease treatment, showing potential in reducing acute exacerbations and improving patients' quality of life. With technological advances and better understanding of aerosol delivery, this therapy has a promising future in respiratory disease management. Future research should focus on confirming its long - term efficacy and safety, exploring personalized applications and evaluating its role in comprehensive treatment strategies.\n\nII. Research Objectives To clarify the process and state of ultrasonic micro - moist rock salt aerosol entering the airway, verify the advantages of the new inhalation device's effective inhalation deposition rate, and provide a new, convenient and effective inhalation technology for drug delivery.\n\nIII. Research Overview 3.1 Overall Research Design and Plan This prospective, randomized, crossover study includes two stages: in - vitro modeling and clinical verification.\n\n3.2 Study Population 3.2.1 Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Healthy volunteers.\n* Patients with chronic airway diseases needing aerosol inhalation therapy.\n\n3.2.2 Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Age under 18.\n* Declining study participation.\n* Needing invasive ventilator support.\n* Having artificial airways.\n* Chronic liver/kidney dysfunction.\n* Allergy to radioactive elements.\n\n3.2.3 Withdrawal Criteria\n\n* Patient's consent withdrawal request.\n* Investigator's medical judgment for termination.\n\n3.3 Sample Size and Grouping The study will recruit 6 healthy volunteers and 20 patients, randomly divided into Group A (ultrasonic rock salt aerosol inhalation first, then small - volume nebulization) and Group B (small - volume nebulization first, then ultrasonic rock salt aerosol inhalation).\n\n3.4 Research Steps and Related Tests Stage 1: In - vitro Modeling Using real human upper airway and asymmetric ideal bronchial tree models, combining 3D printing and CFD simulation to study aerosol deposition rates and distributions in ultrasonic rock salt aerosol inhalation, compared with small - volume nebulizers.\n\n* Build CFD models for upper airway particle deposition based on CT scans.\n* Create CFD models for bronchial tree particle deposition up to the 17th generation.\n* Validate deposition characteristics in a whole airway model.\n\nStage 2: Clinical Verification Using radioactive aerosols and PET/CT imaging to assess lung deposition rates.\n\n* Collect baseline data: demographics, medical history, biochemistry, pulmonary function, etc.\n* Aerosol inhalation: patients inhale aerosols in a separate room, with random order. Use 2ml Ga - 68 EDTA for inhalation.\n* PET/CT imaging: after inhalation, perform low - dose CT for attenuation correction and lung ventilation PET acquisition.\n* Image analysis: use Fiji software and MorphoLibJ plugin to analyze images, calculate deposition rates and concentrations.\n\n3.5 Endpoint Criteria Primary: In - vitro model lung deposition rate, lung drug deposition rate (percentage of deposited drug in lungs relative to total inhaled dose).\n\nSecondary: Peripheral deposition distribution of aerosol particles, residual volume of inhalation device.\n\nIV. Adverse Event Observation\n\n* Radioactive contamination.\n* Adverse events related to ultrasonic rock salt aerosol inhalation: dry mouth, nasal burning, pain, etc.\n* Nebulization - related adverse events: bronchospasm, coughing, etc.\n\nV.

Screening and Baseline Visits (Visit 1) Before the process of the study begins, the study subjects are fully explained about the entire research process and checked whether they meet the selection and exclusion criteria. If the selection criteria are met, a written consent form will be written, basic demographic information (gender, age, medical history (including allergic disease-related and surgical history), and drug administration history (four weeks before registration). We will conduct a survey on subjective symptoms of allergic rhinitis, drug use scores, subjective score indicators, and quality of life evaluation indicators, and double-check the drugs currently being taken by the study subjects.\n\n   If you have previously used drugs for allergic rhinitis, you can maintain the medication without change and prescribe additional relief drugs if necessary.\n2. Installation of air purifier and Study I after randomization Randomization is a method that is divided into groups A and B and is assigned based on a randomized list (random table) with statistician advice at a ratio of 1:1 respectively.\n\n   The first study (Study I) will run for four weeks. During this period, the air purifier will continue to operate, and no indoor ventilation will be performed for these four weeks to reduce other factors that may affect indoor air quality. After four weeks, the air purifier will be remotely controlled, and indoor air quality information will be continuously collected in the filter replacement.\n3. Interim Visit (Visit 2) The subject of the study will visit the hospital with a journal written about the changes in symptoms and the use of drugs after the first operation of the purifier (Study I). During the first and second visits, the symptoms will be checked for differences and whether relief drugs have been used, and additional relief drugs will be prescribed if necessary, along with retraining on the next visit schedule.\n4. Study II progress and end visit after replacement of air purifier filter (Visit 3) To proceed with the second study (Study II), LG Electronics installers revisit each home and install Dual Defense Filter (HEPA + VOC capture filter) in Group A. Conversely, Group B will remove the Dual Defense filter and attach void labels again each. Study II will also run for four weeks, during which the air purifier is continuously running and there is no indoor ventilation.\n\nThe subject of the study should visit the hospital with symptoms and drug use log even at the end of the visit, and the change in symptoms and the use of relief drugs will be confirmed. At the end of the study, we will disclose which group the study subjects were assigned to.",

    "Brief Summary": "Background:\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. Some people who recover from COVID-19 have symptoms that last long after the active infection ends. This is called long COVID. Sometimes, long COVID can affect the nerves and cause problems with sleep, thinking, the senses, and movement. Researchers want to find out whether people with long COVID have retained inactive remnants of SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo collect tissue samples to see if people with long COVID have remnants of SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople 18 years or older who have recovered from COVID-19, both with and without neurologic symptoms.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 2 to 4 inpatient or outpatient visits over 4 months. Each visit will last 4 to 5 days.\n\nParticipants will be screened to make sure it is safe to collect tissue samples from their body. They will have a physical and dental exam. They will have imaging scans and a test of their heart function. They will complete questionnaires about their health. They will give blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples. Their sense of taste and smell will be tested.\n\nTissue samples will be taken from the digestive tract, lungs, colon, skin, muscle, lymph nodes, nasal passages, and mouth. Participants may be numbed or sedated for some of the procedures.\n\nSwabs will be used to collect cells from inside the mouth and nose.\n\nParticipants will undergo lumbar puncture. A thin needle will be inserted into their lower back to draw out a sample of the fluid around their spinal cord.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up phone calls after each clinic visit.",
    "Detailed Description": "Study Description:\n\nIt has been demonstrated that remnants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remain after the resolution of the acute infective period. It is not known if these viral remnants interact with host tissues in the development and maintenance of the Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)/Long COVID. Better understanding of how to recover and characterize SARS-CoV-2 viral remnants from humans is a valuable first step in understanding the health impact that they may have on humans. This study will focus on the recovery and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 remnants from multiple organ sites of individual volunteers with persistent neurological complications from SARS-CoV-2 (Neuro-PASC) and volunteers those who have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection (RV).\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary Objective:\n\n  --To determine where remnants of SARS-CoV-2 virus can be recovered in persons with neuro-PASC and RVs.\n* Secondary Objectives:\n\n  * To characterize the biochemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 recovered viral remnants (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids).\n  * To determine if there are quantitative differences in recovered SARS-CoV-2 proteins between neuro-PASC and RV participants.\n  * To determine if there are quantitative differences in recovered SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids between neuro-PASC and RV participants.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nThis is an exploratory cross-sectional protocol to determine whether the presence or absence of viral remnants can be detected in a range of human tissues. Hence, tissue-specific detection of viral remnants is the primary end point. Secondary endpoints will characterize and quantify the recovered remnants to allow group comparisons between neuro-PASC and RV participants.",

    "Brief Summary": "This study will examine pelvic pain associated with endometriosis and explore better approaches to treatment. In women with endometriosis, uterine tissue grows outside the uterus. Standard treatments - altering hormone levels to prevent endometrial tissue growth or surgically removing endometrial tissue - treat pelvic pain only temporarily. This study will investigate the role of sex hormones, immune chemicals, stress hormones, and genes in pelvic pain and determine how the nerve, muscle, and skeletal systems are involved in this pain.\n\nWomen between 18 and 50 years of age who:\n\n1. have endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain, and\n2. have chronic pelvic pain without endometriosis, and\n3. have neither endometriosis nor chronic pelvic pain and are willing to have a tubal ligation (Healthy Volunteer group),\n\nmay be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a questionnaire to obtain information about their pain and previous treatments and related medical or social issues. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:\n\n1. Medical history and physical examination, including pelvic exam, blood tests, urinalysis, and diaphragm fitting.\n2. Questionnaires about pain, quality of life, sexuality, psychological attitudes, spiritual experiences, and history of headache and depression.\n3. At-home monitoring for 4 to 6 weeks of pain symptoms, menstruation and spotting, medicines taken, and urine collections to test for \"LH\" surge. LH is the hormone that causes the ovary to release a mature egg.\n4. Pre-laparoscopy evaluation to include:\n\n   * Examination of menstrual blood collected in a diaphragm for 4 hours.\n   * Blood sampling to measure adrenal and pituitary hormones. For this test, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is injected through an IV needle. Up to five blood samples are drawn, starting before the injection until 45 minutes after it. Blood is also collected at this time for genetic analysis.\n   * In-depth pain assessment to identify trigger points in muscles associated with pelvic pain, regions of skin sensitivity, and bone pain. Some women will undergo microdialysis, which uses an acupuncture-type needle to collect chemicals from two different muscles.\n   * Blood sampling twice a week for 1 month to measure changes in blood substances during the menstrual cycle.\n   * Blood sampling after the LH surge to measure progesterone levels.\n   * Cervicovaginal lavage (washing of the cervix with saline and collecting the fluid) to obtain secretions for research.\n   * Ultrasound of the ovaries and uterus. This examination uses a probe inserted into the vagina that emits sound waves that are used to form pictures of the internal structures. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.\n   * A visit with the members of the Pain and Palliative care service to evaluate the pain in anticipation of offering other treatments for pain after surgery.\n   * Surgery:\n\nCPP + Endo or CPP only: Laparoscopy to look for and remove endometrial tissue. This procedure is done under general anesthetic. A viewing instrument called a laparoscope is passed through an incision in the belly button to look for endometriosis. If it is found, two or more incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments to remove the tissue. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.\n\nHealthy Volunteers: Laparoscopy to perform the tubal ligation. A tubal ligation, commonly known as \"getting your tubes tied,\" is a surgical procedure for women to sterilize them. This procedure closes the fallopian tubes, stopping the egg from traveling from the ovary to the uterus and preventing sperm from reaching the fallopian tube to fertilize an egg. In a tubal ligation, fallopian tubes are cut, burned, or blocked with rings, bands or clips. The surgery is effective immediately. Tubal ligations are 99.5% effective as birth control. This procedure is done under general anesthetic. A viewing instrument called a laparoscope is passed through an incision in the belly button to perform a tubal ligation. Two or more incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments to perform the procedure. During the laparoscopy, we will look for and remove endometrial tissue. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.\n\n-Follow-up evaluations. Two weeks after surgery, patients return to NIH to discuss the surgical findings and treatment options. Follow-up visits are then scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery to complete questionnaires and determine if the treatment is working. Blood samples are drawn at each visit....",
    "Detailed Description": "Chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis is poorly understood. This study is an effort to better understand pelvic pain and identify novel medical approaches for treating it. Endometriosis is a very common disease of women in their reproductive years, in which endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. In a recent epidemiologic study, we have shown strong associations among endometriosis, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune disorders. Currently, it is believed that endometriosis causes chronic pelvic pain. Yet, some women with endometriosis do not have any pain and others have pain in areas unrelated to endometriosis disease location. The standard approaches to treating endometriosis pain have been to medically alter hormone levels to prevent endometriosis tissue growth or to surgically remove endometriosis lesions. Pelvic pain is only temporarily treated by either approach, which suggests that the current classification of pain, based on disease and treatment with hormones or surgery is not adequate. The feeling of pain involves many complex processes. Generally, women suffer more frequently from chronic, long-term, painful conditions than men. This suggests that women process pain differently because of differences in sex hormone levels and genes expressed in a sexually dimorphic fashion, as well as in central nervous and immune system function differences. We will examine the relations among sex hormones, pain processing, immune system substances and pain related genes. We will also examine changes in levels of hormonal and immune substances in the blood, endometriosis lesions and normal endometrial tissue. Myofascial pain has been noted in women with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. We will study how the nerve, muscle and skeletal systems are involved in pelvic pain by performing an in depth pain assessment. Finally, stress plays an important role generating and perpetuating chronic pain. We will examine how the hormones related to the stress response may be altered in pelvic pain.",

    "Brief Summary": "Critical care patients experience systemic aggression, which may be the result of trauma, infection or other systemic inflammatory mechanisms. The initial phase of their illness is characterized by metabolic instability and increased catabolism. Nutrition goals in these patients are therefore, on the one hand, to provide sufficient caloric intake to cover energy expenditure while limiting the risks of inappropriate under-feeding, overfeeding- or re-feeding syndrome, and on the other hand, to meet the protein requirements linked to hypercatabolism. In the absence of contraindication, current recommandations state that an intensive care patient who cannot be fed orally, shoul receive continuous enteral nutrition over 24 hours by gastric tube within 48 hours of admission.\n\nHowever, this 24-hour continuous nutrition method does not correspond to the physiological habit of the human species which includes a physiological nighttime fasting period.This fasting period induces a metabolic switch that regulates several pathways, including glycemic control, oxidative stressresistance and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. Furthermore, it takes part un the synchronization of cellular circadian rhythms.\n\nInvestigator hypothetises that diurnal cyclic enteral nutrition may improve the prognosis of severe intensive care patients compared to continuous enteral nutrition.",

    "Brief Summary": "Acute kidney injury is a significant complication for infants who experience hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, being associated with increased rates of death and prolonged hospitalization. This pilot study of theophylline administration soon after birth for the prevention of kidney injury will lay the foundation for the conduct of a larger clinical trial that seeks to identify a theophylline as a novel therapy to prevent kidney injury in thousands of at-risk infants.",
    "Detailed Description": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly seen in infants diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no approved therapies that target the prevention of AKI. Several small trials in infants with HIE suggest that a single dose of theophylline given soon after birth attenuates the development of AKI. However, these studies were not performed in infants being treated with therapeutic hypothermia (the current standard of care for moderate to severe HIE), and only reported short-term outcomes. Therefore, few clinicians use theophylline in the management of these patients. The long-term goal is to undertake an appropriately powered multicenter clinical trial to test the hypothesis that for infants \\> 35 weeks gestation treated with therapeutic hypothermia for HIE, intravenous theophylline (or aminophylline) within the first 18 hours after birth will result in a decreased incidence and/or severity of AKI or death (composite primary outcome) and improved long-term (2 year) renal outcomes. Before the conduct of a large trial, the feasibility of implementing the intervention and ability to measure relevant clinical outcomes need to be demonstrated. Therefore, the investigators propose a small pilot and feasibility clinical trial to i) evaluate recruitment, protocol adherence, and data collection procedures in a therapeutic trial of theophylline to decrease the incidence of AKI or death compared to standard treatment in infants with HIE being treated with therapeutic hypothermia; ii) evaluate the utility and applicability of established measures (serum creatinine, urine output, fluid balance) and novel, exploratory approaches to identify AKI in infants; and iii) determine theophylline pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety and preliminary effectiveness profiles of two different theophylline dosing regimens in a therapeutic trial of theophylline to decrease the incidence of AKI or death compared to standard treatment. Using a mixed methods data analysis strategy to assess the research and intervention process and examine outcomes of the intervention, the investigators will generate the requisite data to inform development and implementation of an appropriately powered study to determine whether theophylline attenuates the risk and severity of AKI in infants with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia.",

    "Detailed Description": "Previous studies have shown that the opioid receptor modulator nalmefene can reduce heavy drinking among alcoholics. Genetic variation at the micro-opioid receptor gene locus, OPRM1, specifically the A118G polymorphism, is associated with differential subjective responses to alcohol. Further, the A118G polymorphism has been shown to moderate the effect of opioid receptor modulators on alcohol consumption. However, the role of A118G on nalmefene s effectivenes, and the neural substrates underlying nalmefene s therapeutic effect remain to be explored in humans.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effect of nalmefene on alcohol self-infusion and neural response to alcohol cues in healthy male and female heavy drinkers, and to examine the role of the OPRM1 A118G polymorphism on this effect.\n\nStudy population: Participants will be 21-60 year-old male and female heavy drinkers in good health, as determined by medical history, physical exam, and ECG and lab tests. Participants with current Axis-I mood, anxiety or substance use diagnoses, except alcohol dependence, will be excluded. Participants will be divided into 2 genotypic groups: Group 1 (AA) will include participants homozygous for the major 118A allele (118AA genotype), and group 2 (GX) will include participants carrying 1 or 2 copies of the variant 118G allele (118AG or 118GG genotype).\n\nDesign: Participants will undergo 3 study sessions. In the first session, participants will complete an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA) where they will have an open bar phase to determine their baseline level of alcohol consumption in the laboratory, as well as to obtain data on tolerability and subjective measures of alcohol effects. In the second and third sessions, participants will receive a single dose of either nalmefene or placebo, in counter-balanced order, before completing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and IV-ASA procedures. The fMRI scans will include a task where participants will see cues that indicate the possibility of earning alcohol rewards to examine the neural substrates involved in processing alcohol cues, and a task designed to measure neural responses during anticipation and processing of aversive events. The difference in alcohol self-infusions between the two sessions will be compared between the two genotypic groups.\n\nOutcome measures: The primary outcome measures are: (1) nalmefene-induced changes in IV alcohol self-administration; (2) nalmefene-induced BOLD signal changes in neural regions associated with alcohol reward processing, including ventral striatum, amygdala, and insula.;Secondary outcome measures include: (1) Nalmefene-induced BOLD signal changes in neural processing of aversive stimuli during fMRI; (2) Genotypic modulation (at the OPRM1 118 location) of nalmefene s effects on primary outcome measures (BOLD signal change during alcohol reward processing and IV alcohol self-administration).",

    "Brief Summary": "Premature babies often require breathing support during their neonatal intensive care unit stay. This is because their lungs are not fully developed to perform the work of breathing on their own. Although breathing support can be provided via a breathing tube, it is preferable to provide breathing support non-invasively from a breathing machine which is then connected to a mask or prongs placed on the baby's nose. In premature babies born under 32 weeks gestation, a commonly used mode of non-invasive breathing support is called Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV). In this mode, the breathing machine provides 2 levels of support: one is the constant distending pressure to keep the lungs open and the other provides additional 'breaths' on top of that distending pressure. This is to mimic regular breathing. These breaths are set at a fixed rate and pressure. Although NIPPV protects the lungs from injury caused by a breathing tube, the breaths are not in sync with the baby's own breathing effort. Another mode of non-invasive breathing support recently being used in premature infants called Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA). When NAVA is provided non-invasively using a mask or prongs similar to NIPPV, it is called Non-invasive NAVA (NIV-NAVA). During NIV-NAVA a special feeding tube is used that detects the baby's own breathing movement from the electrical signal of the baby's diaphragm and feeds back to the machine which then provides a 'top-up' to the baby's own breath. This top-up breath also provides only as much pressure as the baby needs on top on their own breathing effort. Therefore, this is thought to be in sync with the baby's own breathing effort. However, it is not known if this mode of ventilation leads to improved sleep, improved brain oxygen levels, reduced discomfort and improved functioning of the diaphragm. The investigators aim to examine these indices in this research project.",
    "Detailed Description": "Rationale: It is imperative to find the optimal method of supporting not only lung development, but also brain development during this critical period of brain growth and development. NIV-NAVA is a more physiologically compatible method of supporting respiration. The investigators hypothesize that this compatibility may increase comfort and restful periods compared to standard NIPPV, and thus, may be more neuroprotective.\n\nObjective and outcomes assessed: The objective is to compare sleep-wake cycling, cerebral oxygenation, heart rate variability and diaphragm function during standard NIPPV and NIV-NAVA modes in preterm neonates born at \\<32 weeks' gestation who are stable on NIPPV or NIV-NAVA for at least 24 hours and are a minimum of 3 days old.",

Participants with cNLBP will be randomized into four groups to receive either the combination of both treatments, each treatment individually with a sham, or both shams. The study will last eight weeks, with four weeks of intervention and four weeks of follow-up. Treatment outcomes, including pain, disability, medication use, and quality of life, will be evaluated, along with monitoring for adverse effects.",
    "Detailed Description": "Low back pain (LBP) is a major public health issue worldwide. In 2020, there were over half a billion cases of LBP globally, and by 2050, the total number of LBP cases is expected to increase by 36.4% worldwide. LBP accounts for 7.7% of total Years Lived with Disability, making it the largest contributor to the global disability burden.\n\nWhen lasting three months or more, LBP is classified as chronic (cLBP). Most cLBP is non-specific cLBP (cNLBP). Managing cNLBP remains challenging. Recommended therapies include short-term medication, manipulation, supervised exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and multidisciplinary treatment. According to the Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians, clinicians and patients should initially consider non-pharmacologic treatments, including acupuncture as one of the options.\n\nThere is evidence regarding the effectiveness of thread-embedding acupuncture (TEA) and auricular acupuncture (AA) in the treatment of cNLBP. TEA uses the principle of selecting points on the body, while AA involves selecting points on the ear. The difference in the point selection principles of these two methods has led clinicians to often combine them in hopes of enhancing treatment efficacy. However, evidence on the effectiveness of combining these two methods in treating cNLBP remains lacking. This study aims to clarify whether the combination of these methods is more effective than using them individually.\n\nEligible participants with cNLBP, defined as LBP lasting more than three months without any reasonable explanation and determined by a physician to be nonspecific, will be enrolled and subsequently randomized into four groups: receiving the combination of TEA and AA (TEA + AA group), receiving TEA and sham AA (TEA + sham AA group), receiving AA and sham TEA (AA + sham TEA group), and receiving sham TEA and sham AA (Sham both group), with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio.\n\nThe study will last for eight weeks, with four weeks of intervention and four weeks of follow-up. AA and sham AA will be administered weekly during the four-week intervention (four sessions). TEA and sham TEA will be administered every two weeks during the four-week intervention (two sessions). Data on treatment efficacy will include disability index, pain score, amount of analgesic medication needed, quality of life score, and global improvement.

Labour force statistics have determined that one third of the loss of labour force occurs after musculoskeletal injuries.\n\nWhen the literature is examined, there are many studies investigating loss of labour force after fractures. It was found that 20% of the patients never returned to work after distal radius fracture and the average loss of labour force was 9.2 weeks. In another study, while the return to work period was 60 days in minor hand injuries, it was reported that the return to work could increase to 360 days in major hand injuries. In another study, the average return to work time in patients aged \\>50 years with fragility fractures was found to be 20.5 days. The rate of return to work after traumatic spinal fracture was found to be only 38.1%.\n\nIn daily practice, the investigators observe that parents frequently do not go to work for child care after child fractures. However, there is no similar study investigating this loss of labour force after pediatric fractures in the literature. In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the loss of parental labour force (LWL) in conservatively followed pediatric fractures",

Researchers want to know more about how PDS changes nerve function.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo compare nerve function in people with PDS to that in people without PDS.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with PDS enrolled in protocol 16-AT-0077. Healthy volunteers are also needed.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have at least 1 clinic visit. They will undergo a test that measures activity in the nerves.\n\nFor the test:\n\nParticipants will place their arm or leg in a comfortable position.\n\nUltrasound will be used to locate nerves. A smooth wand will be slid over the skin to capture images of the structures below.\n\nTwo thin needles will be inserted through the skin. These needles are much smaller than the kind used to draw blood.\n\nThe needles will record nerve activity as different sensations are applied to the skin. These include mild electrical pulses; heat and cold; bending of the knee or elbow; vibration; air puffs; pulling a hair; and tapping, stroking (brushing), stretching, pinching, and pushing on the skin at different levels of force.\n\nEach test takes 5 to 10 minutes. Participants will describe the sensations they feel.\n\nParticipants may opt for an additional test that measures how nerves respond after heat pulses are used to create mild redness on the skin.\n\nResearchers would like at least 2 tests from each person. Participants may return for up to 3 additional visits, if desired, to complete all the testing.",
    "Detailed Description": "Study Description:\n\nThe study aims to characterize peripheral nerve function and physiology in healthy participants and participants with inherited mutations in the PIEZO2 gene (otherwise known as PIEZO2- Deficiency Syndrome \\[PDS\\]). PIEZO2 encodes a stretch-gated ion channel whose function has been shown to be essential for aspects of gentle touch sensation, vibration detection, mechanical allodynia and proprioception in humans. The physiological effects of PIEZO2 mutations on sensory neurons in humans are unknown. The study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms for touch and mechanical pain sensation and determine if the peripheral neurons remain otherwise healthy in the absence of a functioning PIEZO2 channel.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine whether peripheral neurons have a blunted response to gentle mechanical stimulation (e.g., soft brushing) in PDS patients compared to healthy participants using direct electrical recording from peripheral nerves.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo examine the physiological properties of different types of mechanically sensitive sensory neurons in response to innocuous and noxious stimuli in PDS patients and healthy participants. We expect the loss of PIEZO2 to have greater impact on the responsiveness of certain types mechano-receptor subtypes over others.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nOur primary endpoint is evidence of reduced responsiveness (i.e., firing rate \\[Hz\\]) of peripheral neurons to gentle mechanical (brushing) stimulation in PDS patients compared to controls. We expect a reduction of at least 50% in firing rate (Hz).\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\nOur secondary endpoint is the emergence of a differential effect of the loss of PIEZO2 on mechanoreceptor subclasses. Mechanoreceptor subclasses will be identified using established criteria (e.g., stimulus sensitivity, receptive field size, spike morphology and axon conduction velocity). The effect of the loss of PIEZO2 on the responsiveness of single-unit subclasses will be quantified by firing rate measures on single-unit data. In addition, the percept evoked to intraneural electrical stimulation of single-unit subclasses will be noted.",

    "Brief Summary": "Each year, approximately 1500 breast biopsies (1000 microbiopsies and 500 macrobiopsies) are performed in the radiologic department of the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM). This exam, which is relatively easy for the radiologist, can however lead to major anxiety for patients. Indeed, previous studies show that about 50% of women undergoing a breast biopsy have significant anxiety affects.\n\nAnxiety associated with the risks of biopsy, potential breast cancer diagnosis and/or lack of routine sedation procedures increase patient concerns. Distress prior to biopsy is associated with greater pain and discomfort during the procedure. The psychological distress that persists after the biopsy is related to a worse psychological management of side effects of the biopsy breast (e.g., sensitivity, skin irritation).\n\nLimiting apprehension, worry and anxiety induced by the uncertainty linked to the biopsy results and the biopsy-related pain should be an integral part of the medical care through the patient follow-up during, after and until the diagnosis is announced. In light of these challenges, new alternative methods are emerging to enhance patient knowledge, develop procedural skills, improve confidence and mitigate procedural anxiety. However, to our knowledge, few methods have been developed during this period of 'waiting-time'. Currently, only care instructions and a consultation to announce the results (about 10 days after the procedure) are proposed to patients at the end of biopsy. Patients are also encouraged to call if they suspect complications such as infection or bleeding.\n\nIn this context, the investigators propose to integrate a pain management after biopsy via e-health system through the patient's medical care. Radiologist/patient communication could have an impact on patients' anxiety and health-related issues, given the challenging nature of discussions around need for breast biopsy and potential implications of the results. Indeed, paying attention and focusing on symptoms as patients experience them improves their empowerment and their adjustment to the disease.\n\nWeb-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being. In addition, it is known that improved communication between patients and medical staff to less anxiety after a biopsy and that anxiety is related to pain.\n\nTaken as a whole, these elements encourage the integration of e-health and e-PRO for the management of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a biopsy. The benefits of e-PRO are still being discussed in terms of quality of life (Qol) and psychological distress. The investigator propose to integrate two types of e-health intervention: 1/e-PRO collected by connected objects (smartphone or tablet) as they were used in previous studies, and 2/ e-PRO collected by a phone consultation, which values human communication between the medical staff and the patient.\n\nIn case of significant pain, the collection of e-PRO by any of these e-health interventions will generate an alert and a reactive and responsive care.\n\nIn fine, the purpose of this research is to improve the medical organization and care of post-biopsy patients by proposing an innovative connected patient technology, regardless of their remoteness from the hospital.\n\nSocial inequalities will be reduced by lending a tablet to patients who do not have such a device with a 4G key.",

Its purpose is to allow detailed investigation into the hematologic or oncologic problems of these subjects, and the status of other organ systems that would determine their ability to safely tolerate specific aspects of active research protocols. It allows investigation as to whether a donor is HLA matched, fit to receive G-CSF, and fit to undergo apheresis and therefore eligible to participate as a donor on a bone marrow transplant protocol. It also allows the investigation as to whether subjects are eligible for participation as normal volunteer based on protocol eligibility criteria that requires generally good health status by history or physical exam findings, or laboratory assessments. After completion of this screening process, the subject will either be offered a chance to participate in an active research protocol, or if no appropriate protocol is identified, subjects with hematologic or oncologic disease will have recommendations for other treatment options relayed to the primary or referring physician.\n\nPrimary objective is to determine subject eligibility for participation on NHLBI protocols.\n\nPrimary endpoint is the results of clinical, imaging and laboratory assessments.",

    "Brief Summary": "Background:\n\nPeople who have a blood stem cell transplant can sometimes develop cytopenia. This means that their levels of one or more types of blood cell, such as the red cells or platelets, are lower than they should be. This can occur because a person s immune system might attack these cells after a stem cell transplant. Up to 20% of people who have blood stem cell transplants develop cytopenias, which can lead to anemia, severe bleeding, infections, and other problems. Treatments are needed to help keep blood cell levels stable after blood stem cell transplant.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo evaluate the long-term effects of a study drug (fostamatinib) in people with cytopenia after a blood stem cell transplant.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople who responded well to fostamatinib in an earlier study.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam and blood tests.\n\nFostamatinib is an oral tablet taken by mouth. Participants will take the pills at the same dose and frequency as they did during the previous study. They will take the pills for up to 21 months. The dosage of the drug may be reduced over time if their blood cell levels are stable.\n\nParticipants will have a medical assessment every month. This can be with their local doctor or at the NIH clinic.\n\nParticipants will have blood tests every 3 months.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit after they stop taking the drug.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the patient's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Adding pembrolizumab to gemcitabine may delay the return of BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer for longer period compared to gemcitabine alone.",

Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravesically on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycles 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Beginning cycle 5, patients with no evidence of disease after induction receive pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes and gemcitabine intravesically on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAdditionally, patients with T1 tumors undergo a re-staging transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) within 60 days of registration. Patients also undergo urine and blood sample collection, bladder biopsy, cystoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients with evidence of disease (recurrence or progression) or stop study treatment to receive non-protocol treatment during induction are followed up every 6 months for 5 years. Patients who go off treatment due to any reason other than recurrence/progression or receiving subsequent non-protocol treatment during induction will go to clinical follow-up until evidence of disease progression/recurrence. Thereafter, patients are followed up every 6 months until 5 years from registration. Patients who complete scheduled maintenance treatment according to protocol therapy are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years until disease progression/recurrence or receiving subsequent non-protocol treatment. Thereafter, patients are followed up every 6 months until 5 years from registration.

    "Brief Summary": "QUESTION. Does duroplasty improve outcome after spinal cord injury?\n\nWHAT DO WE STUDY? We will investigate whether performing a surgical procedure called duroplasty improves outcomes after spinal cord injury.\n\nWHY SPINAL CORD INJURY? Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that causes permanent disability such as paralysis, numbness and loss of bladder and bowel control. Currently, there are no treatments shown to improve outcome after spinal cord injury.\n\nWHAT IS DUROPLASTY? Duroplasty is an operation that involves opening the tough membrane around the cord, called the dura, and stitching a patch of artificial dura to expand the space around the swollen cord.\n\nWHY IS DUROPLASTY BEING STUDIED? Based on our preliminary evidence, we think that the dura causes cord pressure after injury. We have shown in a small study of patients that performing this operation safely and effectively reduces pressure on the injured cord.\n\nWHO IS ELIGIBLE? Adult patients with severe spinal cord injuries in the neck who will have surgery within 72 hours.\n\nWHAT TREATMENT? Those who agree to take part will be allocated by chance (like tossing a coin) to standard treatment or standard treatment plus duroplasty. Some patients will also be asked to take part in a smaller study that involves placing probes at the injury site.\n\nWHERE? We will recruit patients from U.K. Major Trauma Centres. Most assessments will be done in U.K. Spinal Injury Centres. Later on, we may recruit from overseas.\n\nHOW LONG? We aim to recruit 222 - 260 patients over 4 years. Patients will be followed up for a year.\n\nWHAT DO WE ASSESS? Patients will be assessed (using questionnaires and by examination) how well they can use their hands, walk, control their bladder and bowel and their quality of life. Some of these assessments will be repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.\n\nWHAT IS THE OPTIONAL MECHANISTIC STUDY? DISCUS includes an optional study for at least 50 patients who will take part in the randomised controlled trial. The aim of the mechanistic study is to determine how duroplasty improves outcome, i.e. whether duroplasty reduces cord compression, improves blood flow to the injured cord perfusion, improves cord metabolism and reduces cord inflammation.\n\nWHAT IS THE OPTIONAL INFORMATION STUDY? For the first two years, a study called QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) is designed to optimise patient recruitment and informed consent in the trauma setting.",
    "Detailed Description": "RESEARCH QUESTION: After severe traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), does the addition of dural decompression to bony decompression (includes laminectomy) improve muscle strength in the limbs at 6 months, compared with bony decompression alone? BACKGROUND: TSCI is a devastating condition that affects about 1,000 people in the UK annually. Most remain disabled, tetraplegic or wheelchair bound and are dependent on carers with significant cost to patients, carers and the NHS. Surgery aims to reduce spinal deformity, stabilise the spine and achieve bony decompression of the cord. To date, no treatments have been shown to improve outcome.\n\nAIMS / OBJECTIVES: The primary aim is to determine if, in patients with acute, severe TSCI, the addition of dural decompression to bony decompression improves muscle strength. We hypothesise that, after TSCI, the cord swells and is compressed against the dura. Secondary objectives are to assess patient impact i.e. functional outcomes, health related quality of life (HRQoL), complication rates and mortality. Mechanistic sub-studies aim to determine if the addition of duroplasty improves cord perfusion, reduces cord ischaemia and cord inflammation.\n\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, phase III, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to recruit 222 adults with acute, severe cervical TSCI (American spinal injuries association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A, B or C) who will be randomised 1:1 to undergo bony decompression alone versus bony decompression with duroplasty. Patients and assessors will be blinded to study arm. The primary outcome is change in AIS motor score (AMS) at 6 months compared with admission (Delta-AMS); secondary outcomes will assess function (grasp, walking, urinary + anal sphincters), HRQoL, complications, need for further surgery and mortality, assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months from randomisation. A subgroup of 50 patients (25 per arm) will also have observational monitoring from the injury site using a pressure probe (intraspinal pressure ISP, spinal cord perfusion pressure SCPP) and microdialysis (MD) catheter (cord metabolism: tissue glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR), glutamate, glycerol); cord inflammation: tissue chemokines/cytokines. Patients will be recruited from the 26 UK major trauma centres (MTCs).\n\nTIMELINES FOR DELIVERY: The study duration is 72 months and includes 6 months set-up, 48 months recruitment, 12 months to complete follow-up and 6 months for data analysis and final reporting of results. There will be a formal stop/go review at month 15 (after 9 months of recruitment) to ensure a minimum of 4 sites have been opened and 8 patients randomised. If these targets are met, the trial will recruit for a further 36 months. Data from the pilot will be included in the final analysis.\n\nANTICIPATED IMPACT AND DISSEMINATION: It is anticipated that the addition of duroplasty to standard of care will improve muscle strength in patients; this has obvious benefits for patients and their carers as well as substantial gains for the NHS and society including economic implications. If this RCT shows that the addition of duroplasty to standard treatment is beneficial, it is anticipated that duroplasty will become standard NHS care in all 26 UK MTCs. Participants will be informed of study findings via the Surgical Intervention Trials Unit (SITU) website and the Spinal Injuries Association (SIA).",

    "Detailed Description": "Hemorrhoidectomy is associated with postoperative pain, and no single surgical technique has been proven to reduce the pain significantly.\n\nHowever, there are many drawbacks to such techniques, such as postoperative pain and constipation. The cause of this postoperative pain is multifactorial. Spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) is one of the factors which is exposed and impinged after EH. Therefore, Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is a widely used adjunct treatment after EH, which can abolish spasms of the IAS and subsequently relieve postoperative pain.",
