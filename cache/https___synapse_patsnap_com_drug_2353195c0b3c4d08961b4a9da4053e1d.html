             The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate safety and tolerability of preservative-free parenteral treprostinil in paediatric patients with PAH (PH Group 1) who are below 18 years of age. The main question it aims to answer is:
             <br/>
             • if preservative-free parenteral treprostinil is safe and tolerable in the treatment of paediatric PAH in patients who are either treatment-naïve or have been previously treated with commercially available parenteral treprostinil formulations.
             <br/>
             Participants will receive either subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) preservative-free treprostinil and will be observed for 5 months (20 weeks ± 1 week).

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              Adverse drug events (ADEs) for endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and prostacyclin-related drugs (PRDs) have been reported in clinical trials, but large-scale, real-world evaluations for respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (RTMD) remain scarce.

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              A pharmacovigilance analysis of the FAERS database (Q1 2004~Q2 2024) used the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method for disproportionality analysis to assess the adverse drug events (ADEs) of ERAs and PRDs in pulmonary arterial hypertension, focusing on risks related to RTMD.

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              Reports of ADEs for ERAs (bosentan, ambrisentan, and macitentan) were 15,286, 36795, and 17,497, respectively, and for PRDs (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, and selexipag) were 5,477, 57265, 3,247, and 5,504. Females exceeded males, with most cases in adults. The top PTs for ERAs were death, dyspnea, and pneumonia, with bosentan linked to liver impairment. PRDs commonly cause headaches, flushing, hypotension, edema, and fluid retention. Dyspnea was the most reported RTMD risk for all drugs, and nasal congestion was noted for all. Selexipag had the fewest RTMD-related PTs, and iloprost had the strongest signal for hemoptysis.

              The analysis highlights the RTMD risks of ERAs and PRDs in treating PH and underscores the need for careful monitoring of ADEs to ensure their safe and effective use in clinical practice.

              Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive syndrome characterized by increased pulmonary artery pressure. PH often complicates chronic lung diseases, thus contributing to a substantial disease burden and poor prognosis. The WHO Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension has many subcategories, including sleep-hypoventilation PH, high altitude-PH, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-PH, and interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD), the latter carrying the worst prognosis. ILD is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by cough and shortness of breath and, in progressive forms, irreversible loss of function and respiratory failure. The development of PH in patients with ILD worsens exercise capacity and exertional dyspnea and impairs quality of life. Thus, suspicion and early detection of PH following thorough cardiologic evaluation (i.e., echocardiography, pro-BNP, and right heart catheterization) is paramount for appropriate patient management. For PH secondary to chronic respiratory diseases, current guidelines recommend optimizing the treatment of the underlying respiratory condition and offering long-term oxygen therapy. In recent years, several clinical trials have failed to identify drugs beneficial for group 3 PH. Conversely, the INCREASE trial of inhaled treprostinil has recently provided hope for treating PH-ILD. In this review, we summarize and critically discuss the present and future of the pharmacological management of PH-ILD.

              Here we reported a 41-year-old male patient who presented with shortness of breath after activity. He had a history of methamphetamine snorting, and echocardiography showed a generalized hypokinesia of the right ventricular wall. Right-heart catheterization suggested precapillary pulmonary arterial hypertension, with the possibility of pulmonary hypertension caused by left heart diseases. After receiving a subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil, his condition improved, and his exercise tolerance was better than before.

             SILVER SPRING, Md. &amp; RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Therapeutics Corporation (Nasdaq: UTHR), a public benefit corporation, today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. Full year 2024 revenues rose to a record $2.88 billion , reflecting 24% growth over 2023.
“I want to congratulate every Unitherian for their relentless dedication, which has allowed us to deliver a third consecutive year of record revenue,” said Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D., Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of United Therapeutics. “On top of that, our three-year cascade of clinical and regulatory events is under way: both TETON studies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are enrolled, facilitating data starting the second half of this year; ralinepag, our potentially best-in-class once-daily oral prostacyclin agonist, will generate data next year; and this month we announced FDA clearance to start the first potentially registration-enabling xenotransplantation study with our UKidney.”
Michael Benkowitz, President and Chief Operating Officer of United Therapeutics, added, “Our commercial foundation continues to operate from a place of strength, propelled by robust fourth quarter performance across our product portfolio, which capped a record-setting year. We look forward to continuing this momentum in 2025 as our sales and marketing teams continue their efforts to ensure that prescribers are educated on the benefits of our broad array of treprostinil products, which are widely regarded as a cornerstone for treating pulmonary hypertension.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2023. Total Tyvaso revenues grew by 19 percent to $415.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $350.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This growth was primarily driven by growth in Tyvaso DPI revenues, which resulted from an increase in quantities sold of $62.7 million and, to a lesser extent, a price increase, partially offset by higher gross-to-net deductions. The increase in Tyvaso DPI quantities sold was due to continued growth in the number of patients following the product’s launch, including growth in utilization by patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and, to a lesser extent, increased commercial utilization following implementation of the Part D redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The growth in Remodulin revenues resulted from an increase in U.S. Remodulin revenues and, to a lesser extent, an increase in international Remodulin revenues, driven, in both cases, by an increase in quantities sold. The increase in Orenitram revenues resulted from an increase in quantities sold and, to a lesser extent, a price increase. The increase in Orenitram quantities sold was driven, at least in part, by increased commercial utilization following the implementation of the Part D redesign under the IRA. The increase in Unituxin revenues resulted from an increase in quantities sold and a price increase.
Full Year 2024 Compared to Full Year 2023. Total Tyvaso revenues grew by 31 percent to $1,620.4 million in 2024, compared to $1,233.7 million in 2023. The growth in Tyvaso DPI revenues resulted from an increase in quantities sold of $269.2 million and, to a lesser extent, price increases, partially offset by higher gross-to-net revenue deductions. The increase in Tyvaso DPI quantities sold was primarily due to continued growth in the number of patients following the product’s launch (including by PH-ILD patients) and, to a lesser extent, increased commercial utilization following implementation of the Part D redesign under the IRA. The growth in nebulized Tyvaso revenues resulted primarily from an increase in quantities sold of $51.9 million and, to a lesser extent, a price increase. Growth in nebulized Tyvaso was also driven by continued growth in use by PH-ILD patients. The growth in Remodulin revenues resulted from an increase in U.S. Remodulin revenues, driven by an increase in quantities sold. The growth in Orenitram revenues resulted from an increase in quantities sold and, to a lesser extent, a price increase. The increase in Orenitram quantities sold was driven, at least in part, by increased commercial utilization following the implementation of the Part D redesign under the IRA. The growth in Unituxin revenues resulted from a price increase and an increase in quantities sold.

External research and development primarily includes fees paid to third parties (such as clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, and contract laboratories) for preclinical and clinical studies and payments to third-party contract manufacturers before FDA approval of the relevant product.
(2)
Internal research and development primarily includes salary-related expenses for research and development functions, internal costs to manufacture product candidates before FDA approval, and internal facilities-related expenses, including depreciation, related to research and development activities.
(3)
See Share-based compensation below.
(4)
Other primarily includes upfront fees and milestone payments to third parties under license agreements related to development-stage products, adjustments to the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations, and costs to acquire certain in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) assets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $40.2 million and $8.0 million in expense related to upfront non-refundable licensing payments for drug delivery device technologies and ex vivo lung perfusion technology, respectively. During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded $46.0 million in IPR&amp;D expense in connection with the acquisition of IVIVA Medical, Inc. (IVIVA).
Research and development, excluding share-based compensation. The decrease in research and development expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to IPR&amp;D expense we recorded in connection with the acquisition of IVIVA during the quarter ended December 31, 2023; partially offset by increased expenditures related to manufactured organ and organ alternative projects and upfront non-refundable licensing payments related to ex vivo lung perfusion technology.
The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to: (1) increased expenditures related to manufactured organ and organ alternative projects; (2) non-refundable licensing payments for drug delivery device technologies and ex vivo lung perfusion technology; and (3) increased expenditures related to the TETON studies of nebulized Tyvaso in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. These increases were partially offset by the impact of an IPR&amp;D expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023 in connection with the acquisition of IVIVA, which expense did not recur in 2024.

General and administrative, excluding litigation accrual and share-based compensation. The increase in general and administrative expense for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to increases in: (1) personnel expense due to growth in headcount; (2) legal expenses related to litigation matters; and (3) consulting expenses.
Litigation accrual. As of December 31, 2024, we accrued a liability of $71.1 million related to ongoing litigation with Sandoz Inc., reflecting the final judgment and post-judgment interest accrued through the end of 2024. We currently do not expect that the amount of any loss in excess of this accrual would be material to our financial results; however, the amount ultimately payable, if any, could be higher or lower than this amount depending on the amount of post judgment interest and the outcome of appeals, as discussed in Note 14—Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The litigation accrual is included within selling, general, and administrative in our consolidated statements of operations.
Sales and marketing, excluding share-based compensation. The increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increases in: (1) personnel expense due to growth in headcount; (2) marketing expenses; and (3) consulting expenses.

The increase in share-based compensation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to: (1) an increase in stock option expense due to a greater number of awards granted in 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; (2) an increase in restricted stock unit expense due to a greater number of awards remaining outstanding in 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; and (3) an increase in STAP expense driven by a two percent decrease in our stock price during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a three percent decrease in our stock price for the same period in 2023. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to: (1) an increase in STAP expense driven by a 60 percent increase in our stock price during 2024, as compared to a 21 percent decrease in our stock price during 2023; (2) an increase in restricted stock unit expense due to a greater number of awards granted and remaining outstanding in 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; and (3) an increase in stock option expense due to a greater number of awards granted in 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.
Other (expense) income, net. The change in other (expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to net unrealized gains on equity securities.
Income tax expense. Income tax expense was $343.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $289.5 million for the same period in 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, our effective income tax rates (ETR) were approximately 22 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Our ETR for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased, compared to our ETR for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible acquisition costs and an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in nondeductible compensation.
Share repurchase. In March 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR agreement) with Citibank, N.A. (Citi). Under the ASR agreement, we made an aggregate upfront payment of $1.0 billion to Citi and received an aggregate initial delivery of 3,275,199 shares of our common stock on March 27, 2024, which represented approximately 80 percent of the total shares that would be repurchased under the ASR agreement, measured based on the closing price of our common stock on March 25, 2024.
The share repurchase under the ASR agreement was divided into two tranches, resulting in upfront payments of $300 million and $700 million , respectively. The final settlement of the $300 million tranche occurred in June 2024, and we received an additional 181,772 shares of our common stock upon settlement. The final settlement of the $700 million tranche occurred in September 2024, and we received an additional 90,403 shares of our common stock upon settlement. In total, we repurchased 3,547,374 shares of our common stock under the ASR agreement that we currently hold as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results
Revenues
Total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 rose due to increases in revenue from royalties, collaborations and services, and commercial sales. The rise in royalties was primarily due to higher patient demand for Tyvaso DPI. Collaborations and services revenue grew due to increased manufacturing of Tyvaso DPI for United Therapeutics Corporation ("UT"). Net revenues for Afrezza and V-Go increased primarily as a result of improved gross-to-net percentages and higher demand and, to a lesser extent, pricing for Afrezza, partially offset by a decrease in V-Go product demand.
Operating Expenses and Other Financial Highlights
Cost of revenue – collaborations and services was $14.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $12.0 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 24%. For the full year 2024, cost of revenue – collaborations and services was $59.2 million , compared to $41.9 million , an increase of 41%. These increases are primarily the result of increased manufacturing volume of Tyvaso DPI. Research and development ("R&amp;D") expenses were $11.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $9.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 21%. For the full year 2024, R&amp;D expenses were $45.9 million compared to $31.3 million , an increase of 47%. The increases were primarily attributable to development activities including the ICON-1 clinical study, a Phase 1 clinical study of MNKD-201, and personnel costs primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the Pulmatrix Transaction. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&amp;A") expenses were $24.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $20.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 17%. For the full year 2024, SG&amp;A expenses remained consistent compared to the same period in 2023. This was primarily attributable to a loss of $1.4 million for estimated returns associated with sales of V-Go that pre-date MannKind's acquisition of the product and increases in personnel costs, professional fees and promotional activities, offset by a decrease in selling expenses related to sales force restructuring activities completed during the first quarter of 2024. For the fourth quarter of 2024, MannKind reported net income of $7.4 million , or $0.03 earnings per share – basic, compared to net income of $1.4 million , or $0.01 earnings per share – basic, for the same period in 2023. For the full year 2024, MannKind reported net income of $27.6 million , or $0.10 earnings per share – basic, compared to net loss of $11.9 million , or $0.04 loss per share – basic for the same period in 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2024, MannKind reported non-GAAP net income of $23.0 million , or $0.08 earnings per share – basic, compared to non-GAAP net income of $7.1 million , or $0.02 earnings per share – basic, for the same period in 2023. For the full year 2024, MannKind reported non-GAAP net income of $67.7 million , or $0.25 earnings per share – basic, compared to non-GAAP net income of $5.9 million , or $0.03 earnings per share – basic for the same period in 2023. For a reconciliation of GAAP reported net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for basic weighted average shares to these non-GAAP measures, please see the end of this press release.

_________________(1) Diluted weighted average shares ("DWAS") differs from basic weighted average shares due to the weighted average number of shares that would be outstanding upon exercise or vesting of outstanding share-based payments to employees and conversion of convertible notes. For the year ended December 31, 2024 , DWAS included 9,429 shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of outstanding share-based payments. 6,967 shares issuable upon conversion of our senior convertible notes were excluded as their effect would be antidilutive.
Non-GAAP Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented under GAAP, we are presenting non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share - basic, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We are providing these non-GAAP financial measures to disclose additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, and they are among the indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that we may exclude for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures; and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by us in this report have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table reconciles our financial measures for net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share ("EPS") for basic weighted average shares as reported in our consolidated statement of operations to a non-GAAP presentation:
_________________(1) Represents the non-cash portion of the 1% royalty on net sales of Tyvaso DPI which is remitted to the royalty purchaser and recognized as royalties from collaborations in our consolidated statements of operations.

BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Feb. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024 and provided a business update.
"As we report on the most important year in Insmed's history, we feel we are in a rare position in our industry, with extraordinary opportunities ahead. Our success across all areas of the business in 2024—most notably the delivery of positive data from the landmark Phase 3 ASPEN study of brensocatib in bronchiectasis—has positioned us to potentially reach many more patients suffering from serious diseases, and resulted in significant value creation," said Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed. "In 2025, we look forward to delivering the highly anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib, pending FDA approval, and we are delighted to be one step closer to achieving that goal with the FDA's acceptance of our NDA with Priority Review. Simultaneously, we expect to continue to advance our robust mid- to late-stage pipeline while generating double-digit worldwide revenue growth for ARIKAYCE. We believe that Insmed's strong balance sheet and unique company culture will enable us to deliver on behalf of patients in need."
Recent Progress and Anticipated Milestones by Program:
ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE global revenue grew 19% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting continued strong growth in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed enrollment in the Phase 3 ENCORE study for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease who had not started antibiotics. Total enrollment in the study was 425 patients.
The Company continues to anticipate a topline readout for ENCORE in the first quarter of 2026, with the submission of a supplementary new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for ARIKAYCE in all patients with MAC lung disease in the U.S. expected later in 2026.
Brensocatib 
In February 2025, the FDA accepted the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis and granted the application Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of August 12, 2025. Insmed continues to expect brensocatib will launch in the U.S. in the third quarter, if approved.
Regulatory submissions for brensocatib in the EU, UK, and Japan are planned for 2025, with commercial launches anticipated in 2026, pending approval in each territory.
The Phase 2b BiRCh study of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) remains on track to report topline results by the end of 2025.
The Company has initiated dosing of patients in the Phase 2b CEDAR study of brensocatib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
TPIP 
Insmed presented additional lung imaging data from the Phase 2a study of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) in pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute's 2025 Annual World Congress on February 1, 2025.
Treatment with TPIP resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of blood volume in small arteries and a directional improvement in small-to-large artery volume ratio versus placebo, suggesting small vessel vasodilation and improved pulmonary arteriole recruitment.
In addition, a numerical decrease in high-attenuation abnormality score was observed in patients treated with TPIP.
The Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD in the second half of 2025.
Enrollment in the Phase 2b study of TPIP in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) completed in December 2024, with 102 patients randomized. Insmed continues to anticipate topline data from the study in the middle of 2025, ahead of the anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib.
Gene Therapy
The Company received clearance from the FDA for its investigational new drug (IND) application for INS1201, an intrathecally-delivered gene therapy for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), in December 2024.
Insmed plans to initiate a clinical study of INS1201 in the first half of 2025.
The Company's next two gene therapy candidates, which target amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Stargardt disease, are currently advancing toward the clinic.
Pre-Clinical Programs
Insmed's research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the indications being pursued.
The Company anticipates submitting an average of one to two INDs per year from its pre-clinical research program.
Insmed continues to anticipate the totality of its pre-clinical research programs will comprise less than 20% of overall expenditure.
Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Results 
The following table summarizes fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 and 2023 revenues and revenue growth for ARIKAYCE across all commercial regions:
Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $26.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $18.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $85.7 million compared to $65.6 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in cost of product revenues in the fourth-quarter and full-year primarily reflects growth in ARIKAYCE sales.
Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $179.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $137.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, R&amp;D expenses were $598.4 million compared to $571.0 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in R&amp;D expenses for the fourth-quarter and full-year was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses, as well as stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $142.5 million, compared to $89.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, SG&amp;A expenses were $461.1 million, compared to $344.5 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in SG&amp;A expenses for the fourth-quarter and full-year was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses, as well as stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount in preparation for the anticipated launch of brensocatib in the U.S., pending regulatory approval.
For the fourth-quarter 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $235.5 million, or $1.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $186.1 million, or $1.28 per share, for the fourth-quarter 2023. For the full-year 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $913.8 million, or $5.57 per share, compared to a net loss of $749.6 million, or $5.34 per share, for the full-year 2023.
Balance Sheet, Financial Guidance, and Planned Investments
As of December 31, 2024, Insmed had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.4 billion.
Insmed continues to anticipate full-year 2025 global ARIKAYCE revenues in the range of $405 million to $425 million, representing between 11% and 17% year-over-year growth compared to 2024.

About ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE is approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE® Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and in Japan as ARIKAYCE® inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI). 
About PARI Pharma and the Lamira
®
 Nebulizer System 
ARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care. 
About Brensocatib 
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. 
About TPIP 
Treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with PAH, PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. 
About INS1201
INS1201 is an investigational micro-dystrophin adeno-associated virus gene replacement therapy that Insmed is developing as a potential treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Administered intrathecally, this approach has the potential to target both skeletal and cardiac muscles at lower doses. INS1201 is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S. 
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate. 
Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate. 
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. 
Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. 
Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures. 
Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE. 
Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE. 
Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.  
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside. 
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%).  
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. 
Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.
