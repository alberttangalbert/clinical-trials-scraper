              Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) mediated by CD4
              <sup>
               +
              </sup>
              T helper (Th) cells, and characterized by immune cell infiltration, demyelination and neurodegeneration, with no definitive cure available. Thus, it is pivotal and imperative to acquire more profound comprehension of the underlying mechanisms implicated in MS. Dysregulated immune responses are widely believed to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of MS. Recently, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the involvement of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and tertiary lymphoid-like structures (TLSs) in the pathogenesis and progression of MS. Cathepsin C (CatC) is a cysteine exopeptidase which is crucial for the activation of immune-cell-associated serine proteinases in many inflammatory diseases in peripheral system, such as rheumatoid arthritis and septicemia. We have previously demonstrated that CatC is involved in neuroinflammation and exacerbates demyelination in both cuprizone-induced and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse models. However, the underlying immunopathological mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we established a recombinant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 peptide-induced EAE model using conditional CatC overexpression mice to investigate the effects of CatC on the alteration of CD4
              <sup>
               +
              </sup>
              Th subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh and T regulatory cells. Our findings demonstrated that CatC particularly enhanced the population of Tfh cell in the brain, resulting in the earlier onset and more severe chronic syndrome of EAE. Furthermore, CatC promoted the formation of TLSs in the brain, leading to persistent neuroinflammation and exacerbating the severity of EAE in the chronic phase. Conversely, treatment with AZD7986, a specific inhibitor of CatC, effectively attenuated the syndrome of EAE and its effects caused by CatC both in vivo and in vitro. These findings provide a novel insight into the critical role of CatC in innate and adaptive immunity in EAE, and specific inhibitor of CatC, AZD7986, may contribute to potential therapeutic strategies for MS.

              Bronchiectasis is a chronic inflammatory airway disease. Brensocatib, an oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1), reduces pulmonary inflammation by preventing the activation of neutrophil serine proteases. In the phase II WILLOW trial, brensocatib prolonged time to first exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis. In thispost hocanalysis we compare clinical outcomes in patients from WILLOW according to baseline disease characteristics.

              Airway remodeling is a critical factor determining the pathogenesis and treatment sensitivity of severe asthma (SA) or uncontrolled asthma (UA). The activation of epithelial-mesenchymal trophic units (EMTUs) regulated by airway epithelial cells (AECs) has been proven to induce airway remodeling directly. However, the triggers for EMTU activation and the underlying mechanism of airway remodeling are not fully elucidated. Here, we screened the differentially expressed gene cathepsin C (CTSC; also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 1 [DPP-1]) in epithelia of patients with SA and UA using RNA-sequencing data and further verified the increased expression of CTSC in induced sputum of patients with asthma, which was positively correlated with severity and airway remodeling. Moreover, direct instillation of exogenous CTSC induced airway remodeling. Genetic inhibition of CTSC suppressed EMTU activation and airway remodeling in two asthma models with airway remodeling. Mechanistically, increased secretion of CTSC from AECs induced EMTU activation through the p38-mediated pathway, further inducing airway remodeling. Meanwhile, inhibition of CTSC also reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory factors in the lungs of asthmatic mice. Consequently, targeting CTSC with compound AZD7986 protected against airway inflammation, EMTU activation, and remodeling in the asthma model. Based on the dual effects of CTSC on airway inflammation and remodeling, CTSC is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for SA or UA.

             —FDA Reaffirms Application is Under Priority Review with a PDUFA Target Action Date of August 12, 2025—
BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Feb. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has informed the Company that it does not currently plan to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the New Drug Application (NDA) for brensocatib for patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The FDA provided this update in its Day 74 communication to Insmed.
"We are very pleased with our ongoing communications with the FDA about the NDA for brensocatib," said Martina Flammer, M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer of Insmed. "We are committed to working closely with the agency to successfully complete the review and potentially bring forward this much-needed treatment for patients with bronchiectasis."
The FDA had previously granted Priority Review to Insmed's NDA for brensocatib and set a target action date of August 12, 2025, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This NDA is based on data from the landmark ASPEN study, the largest Phase 3 study ever conducted in patients with bronchiectasis. Brensocatib has the potential to become the first and only approved treatment for bronchiectasis and the first in a new class of medicines called dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitors for the treatment of neutrophil-mediated diseases.
About Bronchiectasis  
Bronchiectasis is a serious, chronic lung disease in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. Today, approximately 500,000 patients in the U.S., 600,000 patients in the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK), and 150,000 patients in Japan have been diagnosed with bronchiectasis, and there are currently no approved therapies specifically targeting bronchiectasis in these regions.
About Brensocatib
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.

—Company Ends 2024 with Approximately $1.4 Billion of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities—
BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Feb. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024 and provided a business update.
"As we report on the most important year in Insmed's history, we feel we are in a rare position in our industry, with extraordinary opportunities ahead. Our success across all areas of the business in 2024—most notably the delivery of positive data from the landmark Phase 3 ASPEN study of brensocatib in bronchiectasis—has positioned us to potentially reach many more patients suffering from serious diseases, and resulted in significant value creation," said Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed. "In 2025, we look forward to delivering the highly anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib, pending FDA approval, and we are delighted to be one step closer to achieving that goal with the FDA's acceptance of our NDA with Priority Review. Simultaneously, we expect to continue to advance our robust mid- to late-stage pipeline while generating double-digit worldwide revenue growth for ARIKAYCE. We believe that Insmed's strong balance sheet and unique company culture will enable us to deliver on behalf of patients in need."
Recent Progress and Anticipated Milestones by Program:
ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE global revenue grew 19% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting continued strong growth in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed enrollment in the Phase 3 ENCORE study for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease who had not started antibiotics. Total enrollment in the study was 425 patients.
The Company continues to anticipate a topline readout for ENCORE in the first quarter of 2026, with the submission of a supplementary new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for ARIKAYCE in all patients with MAC lung disease in the U.S. expected later in 2026.
Brensocatib 
In February 2025, the FDA accepted the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis and granted the application Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of August 12, 2025. Insmed continues to expect brensocatib will launch in the U.S. in the third quarter, if approved.
Regulatory submissions for brensocatib in the EU, UK, and Japan are planned for 2025, with commercial launches anticipated in 2026, pending approval in each territory.
The Phase 2b BiRCh study of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) remains on track to report topline results by the end of 2025.
The Company has initiated dosing of patients in the Phase 2b CEDAR study of brensocatib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
TPIP 
Insmed presented additional lung imaging data from the Phase 2a study of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) in pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute's 2025 Annual World Congress on February 1, 2025.
Treatment with TPIP resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of blood volume in small arteries and a directional improvement in small-to-large artery volume ratio versus placebo, suggesting small vessel vasodilation and improved pulmonary arteriole recruitment.
In addition, a numerical decrease in high-attenuation abnormality score was observed in patients treated with TPIP.
The Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD in the second half of 2025.
Enrollment in the Phase 2b study of TPIP in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) completed in December 2024, with 102 patients randomized. Insmed continues to anticipate topline data from the study in the middle of 2025, ahead of the anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib.
Gene Therapy
The Company received clearance from the FDA for its investigational new drug (IND) application for INS1201, an intrathecally-delivered gene therapy for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), in December 2024.
Insmed plans to initiate a clinical study of INS1201 in the first half of 2025.
The Company's next two gene therapy candidates, which target amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Stargardt disease, are currently advancing toward the clinic.
Pre-Clinical Programs
Insmed's research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the indications being pursued.
The Company anticipates submitting an average of one to two INDs per year from its pre-clinical research program.
Insmed continues to anticipate the totality of its pre-clinical research programs will comprise less than 20% of overall expenditure.
Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Results 
The following table summarizes fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 and 2023 revenues and revenue growth for ARIKAYCE across all commercial regions:
Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $26.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $18.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $85.7 million compared to $65.6 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in cost of product revenues in the fourth-quarter and full-year primarily reflects growth in ARIKAYCE sales.
Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $179.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $137.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, R&amp;D expenses were $598.4 million compared to $571.0 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in R&amp;D expenses for the fourth-quarter and full-year was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses, as well as stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $142.5 million, compared to $89.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, SG&amp;A expenses were $461.1 million, compared to $344.5 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in SG&amp;A expenses for the fourth-quarter and full-year was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses, as well as stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount in preparation for the anticipated launch of brensocatib in the U.S., pending regulatory approval.
For the fourth-quarter 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $235.5 million, or $1.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $186.1 million, or $1.28 per share, for the fourth-quarter 2023. For the full-year 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $913.8 million, or $5.57 per share, compared to a net loss of $749.6 million, or $5.34 per share, for the full-year 2023.
Balance Sheet, Financial Guidance, and Planned Investments
As of December 31, 2024, Insmed had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.4 billion.
Insmed continues to anticipate full-year 2025 global ARIKAYCE revenues in the range of $405 million to $425 million, representing between 11% and 17% year-over-year growth compared to 2024.
The Company plans to continue to invest in the following key activities in 2025:
(i)  commercialization and expansion of ARIKAYCE globally;
(ii)  commercial launch of brensocatib in the U.S., if approved, with advancement of regulatory submissions in the EU, UK, and Japan;
(iii)  advancement of clinical trial programs for brensocatib, including the ongoing Phase 2b BiRCh study in patients with CRSsNP and the Phase 2b CEDAR study in patients with HS;
(iv)  advancement of the clinical trial program for ARIKAYCE, which is intended to satisfy the post-marketing requirement for full approval of its current indication and potentially support label expansion to include all patients with a MAC lung infection;
(v)  advancement of the clinical development programs for TPIP, including the Phase 2b study in patients with PAH and the initiation of a Phase 3 study in patients with PH-ILD;
(vi)  advancement of the clinical trial program for INS1201 in DMD; and
(vii)  continued development of its pre-clinical research programs.

About ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE is approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE® Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and in Japan as ARIKAYCE® inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI). 
About PARI Pharma and the Lamira
®
 Nebulizer System 
ARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care. 
About Brensocatib 
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. 
About TPIP 
Treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with PAH, PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. 
About INS1201
INS1201 is an investigational micro-dystrophin adeno-associated virus gene replacement therapy that Insmed is developing as a potential treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Administered intrathecally, this approach has the potential to target both skeletal and cardiac muscles at lower doses. INS1201 is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S. 
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate. 
Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate. 
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. 
Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. 
Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures. 
Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE. 
Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE. 
Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.  
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside. 
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%).  
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. 
Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. 
U.S. INDICATION 
LIMITED POPULATION: ARIKAYCE® is indicated in adults, who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. As only limited clinical safety and effectiveness data for ARIKAYCE are currently available, reserve ARIKAYCE for use in adults who have limited or no alternative treatment options. This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.

BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Jan. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today provided an update on the Company's commercial and clinical programs and its outlook for 2025. These updates will be discussed as part of the Company's presentation at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Monday, January 13, 2025, at 3:00 p.m. PT (6:00 p.m. ET).
"2024 was an extraordinary year for Insmed, and it is only the beginning of our journey. We believe the upcoming clinical and commercial catalysts have the potential to redefine Insmed from a company that can serve approximately 30,000 patients today to one able to reach more than 2.5 million patients by the end of the decade," said Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed. "As we prepare for the highly anticipated U.S. approval and launch of brensocatib in bronchiectasis in the third quarter of 2025, we continue to advance our additional clinical programs, including TPIP in PH-ILD and PAH, brensocatib in CRSsNP and HS, and our first gene therapy in DMD. In parallel, we expect to continue to drive double-digit ARIKAYCE growth as we await the readout of ENCORE data, which has the potential to unlock a blockbuster opportunity for the brand."
Preliminary Full-Year 2024 Global Net Product Sales (Unaudited)
Based on preliminary unaudited financial information, the Company expects total global net product sales of ARIKAYCE to be approximately $363.7 million for full-year 2024. This represents 19% year-over-year growth versus full-year 2023, including growth across each of our regions, as follows:
These preliminary unaudited results are subject to adjustment. Insmed will report its final and complete fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results in late February 2025. The actual results could be materially different from these preliminary unaudited financial results.
Progress and Anticipated Milestones by Program:
ARIKAYCE
Insmed anticipates 2025 global ARIKAYCE revenues to be between $405 million and $425 million, representing between 11% and 17% year-over-year growth compared to 2024.
The Company has completed enrollment in the ENCORE trial for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease who had not started antibiotics. Total enrollment in the study was 425 patients, exceeding the target enrollment of 400 patients.
The Company continues to anticipate a topline readout for ENCORE in the first quarter of 2026, with the submission of a supplementary new drug application (sNDA) for ARIKAYCE in all patients with MAC lung disease projected for later in 2026.
Brensocatib
Insmed submitted a new drug application (NDA) for brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2024 and is currently awaiting FDA acceptance of that submission. If priority review is granted by FDA and brensocatib is approved, the Company anticipates a U.S. launch in the third quarter of 2025.
Regulatory submissions for brensocatib in the EU, UK, and Japan are planned for 2025, with commercial launches anticipated in 2026, pending approval in each territory.
The Phase 2b BiRCh trial of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) has completed nearly 70% of its target enrollment. Topline data continue to be expected before the end of 2025.
The Company randomized its first participant in the Phase 2 CEDAR trial of brensocatib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in December 2024.
TPIP
Insmed will present the full data from the Phase 2 study of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) in pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute's 2025 Annual World Congress in Rio de Janeiro being held from January 29 through February 1, 2025. The Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 study in PH-ILD in the second half of 2025.
Enrollment in the Phase 2 study of TPIP in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been completed with 102 patients randomized in the study. Topline data from the study are now anticipated in the middle of 2025, ahead of the anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib.
Gene Therapy
Insmed's lead gene therapy is INS1201, an intrathecally-delivered treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
In December 2024, Insmed received clearance from the FDA for its investigational new drug (IND) application for INS1201.
The Company plans to initiate a clinical trial of INS1201 in patients with DMD in the first half of 2025.
Pre-Clinical Programs
Insmed's early-stage research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the indications being pursued.
The Company continues to anticipate that the totality of its early-stage research programs will comprise less than 20% of overall expenditure.
Presentation at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference
Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed, will present at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday, January 13, 2025, at 3:00 p.m. PT (6:00 p.m. ET). A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at . A replay will also be archived for a period of 30 days following the conclusion of the live event.
About ARIKAYCE
ARIKAYCE is approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE® Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and in Japan as ARIKAYCE® inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI).
About PARI Pharma and the Lamira® Nebulizer System
ARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care.
About Brensocatib
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, CRSsNP, HS, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
About TPIP
Treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with PAH, PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S.
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate.
Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate.
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate.
Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate.
Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures.
Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE.
Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE.
Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%).
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol.
Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.
U.S. INDICATION
LIMITED POPULATION: ARIKAYCE® is indicated in adults, who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. As only limited clinical safety and effectiveness data for ARIKAYCE are currently available, reserve ARIKAYCE for use in adults who have limited or no alternative treatment options. This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6. Clinical benefit has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials
.
Limitation of Use
: ARIKAYCE has only been studied in patients with refractory MAC lung disease defined as patients who did not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. The use of ARIKAYCE is not recommended for patients with non-refractory MAC lung disease.
Patients are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit

The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon the Company's current expectations and beliefs, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the Company's actual results, performance and achievements and the timing of certain events to differ materially from the results, performance, achievements or timings discussed, projected, anticipated or indicated in any forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, the following: failure to continue to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE, our only approved product, in the U.S., Europe or Japan (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension, Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product, respectively), or to maintain US, European or Japanese approval for ARIKAYCE; our inability to obtain full approval of ARIKAYCE from the FDA, including the risk that we will not successfully or in a timely manner complete the confirmatory post-marketing clinical trial required for full approval of ARIKAYCE, or our failure to obtain regulatory approval to expand ARIKAYCE's indication to a broader patient population; the risk that the full data set from the ASPEN study or data generated in further clinical trials of Brensocatib will not be consistent with the topline results of the ASPEN study or any additional data published from the ASPEN study; failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for brensocatib, TPIP or our other product candidates in the US, Europe or Japan or for ARIKAYCE outside the US, Europe or Japan, including separate regulatory approval for Lamira® in each market and for each usage; failure to successfully commercialize brensocatib, TPIP or our other product candidates, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities, or to maintain applicable regulatory approvals for brensocatib, TPIP or our other product candidates, if approved; uncertainties or changes in the degree of market acceptance of ARIKAYCE or, if approved, brensocatib or TPIP by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the healthcare community; our inability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from government or third-party payors for ARIKAYCE or, if approved, brensocatib or TPIP, or acceptable prices for ARIKAYCE or, if approved, brensocatib or TPIP; inaccuracies in our estimates of the size of the potential markets for ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP or our other product candidates or in data we have used to identify physicians, expected rates of patient uptake, duration of expected treatment, or expected patient adherence or discontinuation rates;

risk that our current and potential future use of AI and machine learning may not be successful; deterioration in general economic conditions in the US, Europe, Japan and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation, affecting us, our suppliers, third-party service providers and potential partners; the risk that we could become involved in costly intellectual property disputes, be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, and incur costs associated with litigation or other proceedings related to such matters; restrictions or other obligations imposed on us by agreements related to ARIKAYCE, brensocatib or our other product candidates, including our license agreements with PARI and AstraZeneca AB , and failure to comply with our obligations under such agreements;
