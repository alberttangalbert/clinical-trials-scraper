             The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of Liposomal Amikacin for Inhalation (LAI) 590 mg once daily (QD) in Cystic Fibrosis patients with chronic infection due to pseudomonas aeruginosa. This long-term, open-label, multi-cycle extension study enrolled subjects who had successfully completed study TR02-108, were compliant with the study protocol, and did not meet any of the listed study discontinuation criteria. The safety and tolerability of LAI were evaluated for up to approximately 2 years.

              Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent presentation in patients with infective endocarditis (IE), and is associated with poor outcomes. The primary aim of the study was to determine the risk factors for AKI in patients with IE.

              A retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in China from August 2012 to April 2022. The primary outcome was AKI. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for AKI.

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              A total of 594 patients with IE were included, of which 256 (43.1%) experienced AKI. The following variables were found to be independent risk factors for AKI: hypertension (OR 1.96,

               p
              </i>

              infection (OR 2.69,

               p
              </i>

               p
              </i>
              &lt; 0.001). The use of low-dose amikacin (400 mg daily) was associated with a lower incidence of AKI (OR 0.38,
              <i>
               p
              </i>
              &lt; 0.001). Among patients with IE complicated by heart failure, surgery was associated with a lower incidence of AKI (OR 0.21,
              <i>
               p
              </i>

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              AKI is common in IE. Hypertension,
              <i>
               Staphylococcus aureus
              </i>
              infection, heart failure, shock and hematuria are risk factors of IE-associated AKI, whereas low-dose amikacin is a protective factor. Surgery is a protective factor of AKI in the setting of IE complicated by heart failure.

              The multidrug-resistant clone identified as Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (E. coli ST131) has spread worldwide. The current study is one of the first comprehensive investigations to ascertain the prevalence of ST131 and molecularly characterize the ST131-O25b and ST131-O16 subgroups causing bloodstream infections in Iran.

              To this end, 119 consecutive, non-repetitive E. coli clinical strains were isolated from blood samples of patients with septicemia in different hospital wards for one year in Tehran. The isolates were provided by the laboratories of tertiary hospitals affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The disk diffusion method was used to investigate the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics. All phylogroup B2 isolates were screened for E. coli ST131 status using a triplex PCR assay that combines the identification of ST131-O25b and -O16 clades. The seven putative virulence factor genes (kpmstII, fimH, afa A, iroN, Sat, ibeA, and ompT) and resistance genes (bla

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              The highest incidence of antibiotic resistance among 74/119 (62.18%) extended-spectrum β-lactamases-producing E. coli isolates was observed, respectively, against Nalidixic acid (82%), and Aztreonam (75%), followed by Ciprofloxacin (70%). Twenty out of 74 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were found to be ST131 (27%), with 13 (65%) ST131-O25b and 7 (35%) ST131-O16 clades, respectively. The ST131-O16 isolates had a higher prevalence of resistance to Ceftriaxone, Amikacin, Aztreonam, and Cefepime than the -O25b ones. Concerning virulence capacity, our findings demonstrated that kpmstII, fimH, and ompT genes were found in 85%, 65%, and 30% of ST131 isolates, respectively. Our results reinforce the surveillance of E. coli ST131 clone dissemination as a major drug-resistant pathogen and an important new public health threat in Iran. Accumulation of multiple virulence factors, ESBL carriage, and identified antimicrobial resistance patterns of ST131-O25b and ST131-O16 clones indicate a necessity to develop strategies to control the spread of these isolates in both community and hospital settings.

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections, particularly in burn and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and is notorious for its high level of antibiotic resistance. This study aims to evaluate the antibacterial potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Acroptilon repens extract as a promising alternative treatment for combating multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.

             <div class="text-black-default text-sm" style="word-break:break-word;">
              Twelve clinical isolates of A. baumannii were identified through biochemical testing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method revealed universal resistance to ceftazidime, amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, while all isolates remained sensitive to colistin (p ≤ 0.05). AgNPs were synthesized using A. repens extract and characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), particle size analysis (PSA), UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). TEM analysis showed that the AgNPs had a spherical morphology with an average particle size of approximately 30 nm, while SEM confirmed their spherical shape and size distribution, ranging from 10 to 130 nm, with a mean size of 38.89 nm. UV-Vis spectroscopy confirmed the successful formation of AgNPs, indicated by a distinct broad absorption peak between 400 and 480 nm. XRD analysis validated the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles, with characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 38.21°, 46.28°, 64.57°, and 77.49°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) silver. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which ranged from 50 to 400 µg/mL. The highest inhibitory activity was observed at 400 µg/mL. Gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated downregulation of the oprD and carO porin genes following AgNP treatment. However, these reductions were not statistically significant (p = 0.302 and p = 0.198, respectively).

              AgNPs synthesized from A. repens demonstrated strong antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. While downregulation of porin genes was observed, further investigation is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action and assess their potential clinical applications. These findings support the potential of AgNPs as an alternative therapeutic strategy for addressing A. baumannii infections resistant to conventional antibiotics.

—Company Ends 2024 with Approximately $1.4 Billion of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities—
BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Feb. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024 and provided a business update.
"As we report on the most important year in Insmed's history, we feel we are in a rare position in our industry, with extraordinary opportunities ahead. Our success across all areas of the business in 2024—most notably the delivery of positive data from the landmark Phase 3 ASPEN study of brensocatib in bronchiectasis—has positioned us to potentially reach many more patients suffering from serious diseases, and resulted in significant value creation," said Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed. "In 2025, we look forward to delivering the highly anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib, pending FDA approval, and we are delighted to be one step closer to achieving that goal with the FDA's acceptance of our NDA with Priority Review. Simultaneously, we expect to continue to advance our robust mid- to late-stage pipeline while generating double-digit worldwide revenue growth for ARIKAYCE. We believe that Insmed's strong balance sheet and unique company culture will enable us to deliver on behalf of patients in need."
Recent Progress and Anticipated Milestones by Program:
ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE global revenue grew 19% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting continued strong growth in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed enrollment in the Phase 3 ENCORE study for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease who had not started antibiotics. Total enrollment in the study was 425 patients.
The Company continues to anticipate a topline readout for ENCORE in the first quarter of 2026, with the submission of a supplementary new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for ARIKAYCE in all patients with MAC lung disease in the U.S. expected later in 2026.
Brensocatib 
In February 2025, the FDA accepted the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis and granted the application Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of August 12, 2025. Insmed continues to expect brensocatib will launch in the U.S. in the third quarter, if approved.
Regulatory submissions for brensocatib in the EU, UK, and Japan are planned for 2025, with commercial launches anticipated in 2026, pending approval in each territory.
The Phase 2b BiRCh study of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) remains on track to report topline results by the end of 2025.
The Company has initiated dosing of patients in the Phase 2b CEDAR study of brensocatib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
TPIP 
Insmed presented additional lung imaging data from the Phase 2a study of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) in pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute's 2025 Annual World Congress on February 1, 2025.
Treatment with TPIP resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of blood volume in small arteries and a directional improvement in small-to-large artery volume ratio versus placebo, suggesting small vessel vasodilation and improved pulmonary arteriole recruitment.
In addition, a numerical decrease in high-attenuation abnormality score was observed in patients treated with TPIP.
The Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD in the second half of 2025.
Enrollment in the Phase 2b study of TPIP in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) completed in December 2024, with 102 patients randomized. Insmed continues to anticipate topline data from the study in the middle of 2025, ahead of the anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib.
Gene Therapy
The Company received clearance from the FDA for its investigational new drug (IND) application for INS1201, an intrathecally-delivered gene therapy for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), in December 2024.
Insmed plans to initiate a clinical study of INS1201 in the first half of 2025.
The Company's next two gene therapy candidates, which target amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Stargardt disease, are currently advancing toward the clinic.
Pre-Clinical Programs
Insmed's research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the indications being pursued.
The Company anticipates submitting an average of one to two INDs per year from its pre-clinical research program.
Insmed continues to anticipate the totality of its pre-clinical research programs will comprise less than 20% of overall expenditure.

Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $26.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $18.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $85.7 million compared to $65.6 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in cost of product revenues in the fourth-quarter and full-year primarily reflects growth in ARIKAYCE sales.
Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $179.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $137.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, R&amp;D expenses were $598.4 million compared to $571.0 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in R&amp;D expenses for the fourth-quarter and full-year was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses, as well as stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $142.5 million, compared to $89.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full-year 2024, SG&amp;A expenses were $461.1 million, compared to $344.5 million for the full-year 2023. The increase in SG&amp;A expenses for the fourth-quarter and full-year was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses, as well as stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount in preparation for the anticipated launch of brensocatib in the U.S., pending regulatory approval.
For the fourth-quarter 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $235.5 million, or $1.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $186.1 million, or $1.28 per share, for the fourth-quarter 2023. For the full-year 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $913.8 million, or $5.57 per share, compared to a net loss of $749.6 million, or $5.34 per share, for the full-year 2023.

About ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE is approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE® Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and in Japan as ARIKAYCE® inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI). 
About PARI Pharma and the Lamira
®
 Nebulizer System 
ARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care. 
About Brensocatib 
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. 
About TPIP 
Treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with PAH, PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction. 
About INS1201
INS1201 is an investigational micro-dystrophin adeno-associated virus gene replacement therapy that Insmed is developing as a potential treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Administered intrathecally, this approach has the potential to target both skeletal and cardiac muscles at lower doses. INS1201 is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S. 
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate. 
Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate. 
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. 
Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate. 
Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures. 
Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE. 
Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE. 
Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.  
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside. 
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%).  
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. 
Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. 
U.S. INDICATION 
LIMITED POPULATION: ARIKAYCE® is indicated in adults, who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. As only limited clinical safety and effectiveness data for ARIKAYCE are currently available, reserve ARIKAYCE for use in adults who have limited or no alternative treatment options. This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. 
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6.

BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Jan. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today provided an update on the Company's commercial and clinical programs and its outlook for 2025. These updates will be discussed as part of the Company's presentation at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Monday, January 13, 2025, at 3:00 p.m. PT (6:00 p.m. ET).
"2024 was an extraordinary year for Insmed, and it is only the beginning of our journey. We believe the upcoming clinical and commercial catalysts have the potential to redefine Insmed from a company that can serve approximately 30,000 patients today to one able to reach more than 2.5 million patients by the end of the decade," said Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed. "As we prepare for the highly anticipated U.S. approval and launch of brensocatib in bronchiectasis in the third quarter of 2025, we continue to advance our additional clinical programs, including TPIP in PH-ILD and PAH, brensocatib in CRSsNP and HS, and our first gene therapy in DMD. In parallel, we expect to continue to drive double-digit ARIKAYCE growth as we await the readout of ENCORE data, which has the potential to unlock a blockbuster opportunity for the brand."
Preliminary Full-Year 2024 Global Net Product Sales (Unaudited)
Based on preliminary unaudited financial information, the Company expects total global net product sales of ARIKAYCE to be approximately $363.7 million for full-year 2024. This represents 19% year-over-year growth versus full-year 2023, including growth across each of our regions, as follows:
These preliminary unaudited results are subject to adjustment. Insmed will report its final and complete fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results in late February 2025. The actual results could be materially different from these preliminary unaudited financial results.
Progress and Anticipated Milestones by Program:
ARIKAYCE
Insmed anticipates 2025 global ARIKAYCE revenues to be between $405 million and $425 million, representing between 11% and 17% year-over-year growth compared to 2024.
The Company has completed enrollment in the ENCORE trial for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease who had not started antibiotics. Total enrollment in the study was 425 patients, exceeding the target enrollment of 400 patients.
The Company continues to anticipate a topline readout for ENCORE in the first quarter of 2026, with the submission of a supplementary new drug application (sNDA) for ARIKAYCE in all patients with MAC lung disease projected for later in 2026.
Brensocatib
Insmed submitted a new drug application (NDA) for brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2024 and is currently awaiting FDA acceptance of that submission. If priority review is granted by FDA and brensocatib is approved, the Company anticipates a U.S. launch in the third quarter of 2025.
Regulatory submissions for brensocatib in the EU, UK, and Japan are planned for 2025, with commercial launches anticipated in 2026, pending approval in each territory.
The Phase 2b BiRCh trial of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) has completed nearly 70% of its target enrollment. Topline data continue to be expected before the end of 2025.
The Company randomized its first participant in the Phase 2 CEDAR trial of brensocatib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in December 2024.
TPIP
Insmed will present the full data from the Phase 2 study of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) in pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute's 2025 Annual World Congress in Rio de Janeiro being held from January 29 through February 1, 2025. The Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 study in PH-ILD in the second half of 2025.
Enrollment in the Phase 2 study of TPIP in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been completed with 102 patients randomized in the study. Topline data from the study are now anticipated in the middle of 2025, ahead of the anticipated U.S. launch of brensocatib.
Gene Therapy
Insmed's lead gene therapy is INS1201, an intrathecally-delivered treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
In December 2024, Insmed received clearance from the FDA for its investigational new drug (IND) application for INS1201.
The Company plans to initiate a clinical trial of INS1201 in patients with DMD in the first half of 2025.
Pre-Clinical Programs
Insmed's early-stage research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the indications being pursued.
The Company continues to anticipate that the totality of its early-stage research programs will comprise less than 20% of overall expenditure.
Presentation at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference
Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed, will present at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday, January 13, 2025, at 3:00 p.m. PT (6:00 p.m. ET). A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at . A replay will also be archived for a period of 30 days following the conclusion of the live event.
About ARIKAYCE
ARIKAYCE is approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE® Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and in Japan as ARIKAYCE® inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI).
About PARI Pharma and the Lamira® Nebulizer System
ARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care.
About Brensocatib
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, CRSsNP, HS, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
About TPIP
Treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with PAH, PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S.
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate.
Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate.
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate.
Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate.
Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures.
Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE.
Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE.
Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%).
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol.
Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.
U.S. INDICATION
LIMITED POPULATION: ARIKAYCE® is indicated in adults, who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy.

BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Oct. 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.
"I am pleased with the progress the Company is making across multiple ongoing initiatives this quarter." said Will Lewis, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Insmed. "We remain on track to file our NDA for brensocatib in the fourth quarter of 2024 and continue to expect a potential U.S. launch in the middle of 2025. We have also made great progress on the clinical side, with the ENCORE and PAH studies nearing full enrollment. All of this has been accomplished while delivering yet another quarter of double-digit growth for ARIKAYCE in each of our three commercial regions. With our demonstrated ability to execute both clinically and commercially, and a strengthened balance sheet due to actions we have taken to lower our cost of capital while adding to our cash balance, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on the tremendous opportunities ahead."
Recent Pillar Highlights 
Pillar 1: ARIKAYCE 
ARIKAYCE global revenue grew 18% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an all-time revenue high and double-digit year-over-year growth in the U.S., Japan, and Europe and rest of world.
Insmed has closed screening of new patients for the ENCORE study and is now expected to exceed its target enrollment of 400 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung infection who have not started antibiotics.
The Company is scheduled to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the fourth quarter to discuss the possibility of an accelerated approval to expand the label for ARIKAYCE to include all patients with MAC lung infection, based on the positive Phase 3 ARISE trial data. Insmed continues to expect that the full data from the ongoing ENCORE trial will be required for approval.
Pillar 2: Brensocatib 
Insmed remains on track to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis in the fourth quarter of 2024. If priority review is granted and brensocatib is approved, Insmed anticipates a U.S. launch in mid-2025. Launches in Europe and Japan are expected in the first half of 2026, pending approvals.
New subpopulation data from 19 pre-specified categories of patients in the ASPEN study were presented in October 2024 at the American College of Chest Physicians Annual Meeting in Boston. The annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations favored brensocatib at both the 10 mg and 25 mg doses over placebo for almost all subgroups. In a separate analysis, least squares mean difference for brensocatib 25 mg demonstrated a reduced decline in post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 52 versus placebo for all prespecified subgroups.
Insmed is advancing launch readiness activities in the U.S. and has hired, trained, and deployed 120 additional therapeutic sales specialists in advance of launch, focused on bronchiectasis disease-state awareness with an expanded group of pulmonologists while also supporting the growth of ARIKAYCE.
The Company continues to enroll patients in the Phase 2b BiRCh trial of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and anticipates providing top-line data from the study in the second half of 2025.
The Company is preparing to activate the first U.S. clinical site for its Phase 2 study of brensocatib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) by the end of 2024.
Pillar 3: TPIP 
Enrollment remains ongoing in the Phase 2 study of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), with more than 90% of the target enrollment currently complete.
Insmed remains on track to report topline results from the PAH study in the second half of 2025.
The Company continues to anticipate initiating a Phase 3 study of TPIP in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) in the second half of 2025.
Pillar 4: Early-Stage Research
Insmed's early-stage research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies.
The Company continues to anticipate the totality of its early-stage research programs will comprise less than 20% of overall spend.
Corporate Updates
Insmed has taken the following actions intended to further strengthen its balance sheet and financial position:
(i) During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the redemption of its $225 million convertible notes due in January 2025. Insmed issued approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock in connection with the redemption and earlier conversions of notes.
(ii) The Company raised an additional $371 million in net proceeds under its at-the-market equity offering program during the third quarter, at an average sales price of $75.64 per share.
(iii) In October 2024, Insmed entered into an agreement to amend its $350 million term loan with investment funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP. Under the terms of the amended agreement, investment funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP will provide an additional $150 million in proceeds, to be received in the fourth quarter of 2024. The maturity date for the full principal amount was extended to 2029, and will carry a reduced fixed-interest rate in the high-single digits.
In October 2024, Insmed announced that it has earned the No. 1 ranking in Science's 2024 Top Employers Survey, marking the fourth consecutive year in which Insmed achieved the top ranking. The annual survey polls employees in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and related industries to determine the 20 best employers, as well as their driving characteristics.
Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results 
Total revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $93.4 million, reflecting 18% year-over-year growth compared to total revenue of $79.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.
Total revenue for third-quarter 2024 included ARIKAYCE net sales of $66.9 million in the U.S., $21.0 million in Japan, and $5.6 million in Europe and rest of world. Third-quarter 2024 sales demonstrated year-over-year growth of 13% in the U.S., 31% in Japan, and 45% in Europe and rest of world, reflecting continued growth trends for ARIKAYCE in these regions.
Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) was $21.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $16.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting increased sales volumes of ARIKAYCE.
Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $150.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $109.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in R&amp;D expenses was primarily driven by increases in manufacturing and compensation and benefit-related expenses.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $118.9 million, compared to $90.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses resulted primarily from increases in compensation and benefit-related expenses and stock-based compensation costs due to an increase in headcount associated with launch readiness activities for brensocatib.
For the third quarter of 2024, Insmed reported a net loss of $220.5 million, or $1.27 per share, compared to a net loss of $158.9 million, or $1.11 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.
Balance Sheet, Financial Guidance, and Planned Investments
As of September 30, 2024, Insmed had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1,467.9 million.
Insmed is reiterating its guidance for full-year 2024 global ARIKAYCE revenues in the range of $340 million to $360 million, representing 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint compared to 2023.
Insmed continues to anticipate that over 80% of total expenditures will be on its clinical and commercial programs, and that less than 20% of overall spend will be on its early-stage research programs, reflecting the Company's historical approach to spending.
The Company plans to continue to invest in the following key activities in 2024:
(i) commercialization and continued growth of ARIKAYCE in its current indication globally, as well as advancement of the clinical trial program intended to potentially support label expansion to include all patients with a MAC lung infection and to satisfy the post-marketing requirement for full approval of its current indication;
(ii) advancement of brensocatib, including:
a. activities related to regulatory filing and commercial launch readiness for bronchiectasis and
b. the ongoing Phase 2 BiRCh trial in patients with CRSsNP and the anticipated Phase 2 program in HS;
(iii) advancement of its clinical development programs for TPIP; and
(iv) development of its early-stage research programs.

About ARIKAYCE
ARIKAYCE is approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE® Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion, and in Japan as ARIKAYCE® inhalation 590 mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). Current international treatment guidelines recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for appropriate patients. ARIKAYCE is a novel, inhaled, once-daily formulation of amikacin, an established antibiotic that was historically administered intravenously and associated with severe toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Insmed's proprietary PULMOVANCE® liposomal technology enables the delivery of amikacin directly to the lungs, where liposomal amikacin is taken up by lung macrophages where the infection resides, while limiting systemic exposure. ARIKAYCE is administered once daily using the Lamira® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH (PARI).
About PARI Pharma and the Lamira® Nebulizer System
ARIKAYCE is delivered by a novel inhalation device, the Lamira® Nebulizer System, developed by PARI. Lamira® is a quiet, portable nebulizer that enables efficient aerosolization of ARIKAYCE via a vibrating, perforated membrane. Based on PARI's 100-year history working with aerosols, PARI is dedicated to advancing inhalation therapies by developing innovative delivery platforms to improve patient care.
About Brensocatib 
Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, CRSsNP, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
About TPIP
Treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP) is a dry powder formulation of treprostinil palmitil, a treprostinil prodrug consisting of treprostinil linked by an ester bond to a 16-carbon chain. Developed entirely in Insmed's laboratories, TPIP is a potentially highly differentiated prostanoid being evaluated for the treatment of patients with PAH, PH-ILD, and other rare and serious pulmonary disorders. TPIP is administered in a capsule-based inhalation device. TPIP is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND BOXED WARNING FOR ARIKAYCE IN THE U.S.
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids. If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate.
Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17.9%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (12.5%). If hemoptysis occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate.
Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%). If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate.
Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infective exacerbation of COPD, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (14.8%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat patients as medically appropriate.
Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures.
Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (7.6% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm). Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage patients as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE.
Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than background regimen alone. Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE.
Neuromuscular Blockade: Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, should be closely monitored since aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero. Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
Contraindications: ARIKAYCE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.
Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 at an incidence ≥5% for patients using ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to patients treated with background regimen alone were dysphonia (47% vs 1%), cough (39% vs 17%), bronchospasm (29% vs 11%), hemoptysis (18% vs 13%), ototoxicity (17% vs 10%), upper airway irritation (17% vs 2%), musculoskeletal pain (17% vs 8%), fatigue and asthenia (16% vs 10%), exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%), diarrhea (13% vs 5%), nausea (12% vs 4%), pneumonia (10% vs 8%), headache (10% vs 5%), pyrexia (7% vs 5%), vomiting (7% vs 4%), rash (6% vs 2%), decreased weight (6% vs 1%), change in sputum (5% vs 1%), and chest discomfort (5% vs 3%).
Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with medications associated with neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Avoid concomitant use of ARIKAYCE with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol.
Overdosage: Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of ARIKAYCE have not been identified. Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of ARIKAYCE, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing amikacin from the body. In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment.
